Issue Trees: Structured Analysis and Prioritization
Objective: Break down complex legal problems into hierarchical, prioritized sub-issues to ensure systematic analysis.
Framework Steps:
Define the Core Legal Problem:
Identify the overarching question (e.g., "Is the defendant guilty of burglary?" or "Does the plaintiff’s contract claim hold?").
Branch into Major Issues:
Decompose the problem into mutually exclusive, top-level issues (e.g., for burglary: "Intent to Commit a Crime," "Unauthorized Entry," "Breaking").
Subdivide Each Issue:
Further break down major issues into sub-issues (e.g., under "Intent," analyze "Knowledge of Trespass" and "Purpose to Steal").
Ensure each branch is MECE (no overlap between branches).
Prioritize Issues by Impact:
Rank branches by:
Legal Significance: Which issues are most critical to the case outcome?
Evidence Strength: Which branches have the strongest/weakest factual support?
Strategic Risk: Which issues could lead to case dismissal or acquittal?
Example: A DA might prioritize "Intent" over "Breaking" if intent is harder to prove.
Validate Completeness:
Use a checklist to confirm all relevant legal elements and defenses are covered.
Example: For a contract dispute, ensure "Offer," "Acceptance," "Consideration," and "Capacity" are all addressed.
Refine and Adjust:
Update the tree as new evidence or arguments emerge.
DA Example:
In a burglary case, the DA’s Issue Tree might branch into "Intent," "Unauthorized Entry," and "Breaking." Sub-issues under "Intent" could include "Evidence of Planning" and "Prior Statements."
Defense Example:
A defense attorney’s tree for a DUI case might prioritize "Blood Alcohol Level," "Driving Under the Influence," and "Validity of Testing." Sub-issues under "Testing" could challenge chain-of-custody or calibration errors.
2. IRAC: Methodology for Legal Analysis
Objective: Systematically dissect legal problems by isolating the issue, rule, application, and conclusion.
Framework Steps:
Identify the Core Legal Issue (Issue):
State the specific question the court must resolve (e.g., "Did the defendant’s actions constitute negligence under tort law?").
State the Governing Rule (Rule):
Cite the legal standard (statute, case law, or doctrine).
Example: For negligence, cite the "duty of care" standard from Donoghue v. Stevenson.
Apply the Rule to the Facts (Application):
Analyze how the facts of the case align with or contradict the rule.
Use fact-specific reasoning (e.g., "The defendant failed to maintain their vehicle, breaching the duty of care owed to pedestrians").
Draw a Conclusion (Conclusion):
Based on the application, state whether the rule is satisfied or violated.
Example: "The defendant’s failure to inspect brakes constitutes negligence, satisfying the elements of tort liability."
DA Example:
Issue: "Did the defendant’s actions meet the legal definition of robbery?"
Rule: "Robbery requires force or intimidation to take property."
Application: "The defendant used a weapon to threaten the victim, satisfying the 'force' element."
Conclusion: "The defendant is guilty of robbery."
Defense Example:
Issue: "Was the search of the defendant’s home constitutional?"
Rule: "The Fourth Amendment prohibits unreasonable searches without a warrant."
Application: "Officers entered without a warrant and no exigent circumstances existed."
Conclusion: "The search violated the Fourth Amendment; evidence should be suppressed."
