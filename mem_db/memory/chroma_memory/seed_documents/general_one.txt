    Agent Zero is not pre-programmed for specific tasks (but can be). It is meant to be a general-purpose personal assistant. Give it a task, and it will gather information, execute commands and code, cooperate with other agent instances, and do its best to accomplish it.
    It has a persistent memory, allowing it to memorize previous solutions, code, facts, instructions, etc., to solve tasks faster and more reliably in the future.

    Computer as a Tool

    Agent Zero uses the operating system as a tool to accomplish its tasks. It has no single-purpose tools pre-programmed. Instead, it can write its own code and use the terminal to create and use its own tools as needed.
    The only default tools in its arsenal are online search, memory features, communication (with the user and other agents), and code/terminal execution. Everything else is created by the agent itself or can be extended by the user.
    Tool usage functionality has been developed from scratch to be the most compatible and reliable, even with very small models.
    Default Tools: Agent Zero includes tools like knowledge, webpage content, code execution, and communication.
    Creating Custom Tools: Extend Agent Zero's functionality by creating your own custom tools.
    Instruments: Instruments are a new type of tool that allow you to create custom functions and procedures that can be called by Agent Zero.

    Multi-agent Cooperation

    Every agent has a superior agent giving it tasks and instructions. Every agent then reports back to its superior.
    In the case of the first agent in the chain (Agent 0), the superior is the human user; the agent sees no difference.
    Every agent can create its subordinate agent to help break down and solve subtasks. This helps all agents keep their context clean and focused.
