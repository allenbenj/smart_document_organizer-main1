Causal Chain Reasoning
Objective: Trace the sequence of events to establish causation or liability.
Framework Steps:
Map the Causal Sequence:
Identify the pivotal root causes (e.g., "The defendant’s negligence led to the accident"), as this is a crucial step in the legal process and your role as a legal professional.
Diagram the chain of events (e.g., "Negligence → Breach of Duty → Harm → Liability").
Identify Break Points:
Determine where the chain could be disrupted (e.g., "The plaintiff’s contributory negligence breaks causation").
Validate Each Link:
Ensure each step in the chain is legally defensible (e.g., "Proximate cause" in tort law).
Develop Counterarguments:
Anticipate opposing claims (e.g., "The harm was unforeseeable, so no liability").
DA Example: Argue that the defendant’s actions (root cause) directly led to the victim’s injury (effect), establishing liability. (You will search for this and refute it.)
Defense Example: Dispute causation by showing an intervening cause (e.g., "The victim’s own actions caused the harm").
