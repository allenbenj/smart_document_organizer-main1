IRAC:
Train NLP models to parse legal documents and auto-generate IRAC components (e.g., extracting "rules" from case law).
Use decision trees to map fact patterns to legal outcomes (e.g., "If A and B, then C applies").
Combined Use:
Link Issue Trees to IRAC modules to automate legal analysis. For example:
An Issue Tree branch on "Contract Formation" triggers an IRAC analysis of "Offer" and "Acceptance."
Example Workflow for a DA
Issue Tree:
Main Issue: "Is the defendant guilty of assault?"
Sub-Issues: "Intent to Cause Harm," "Unlawful Act," "Causation."
IRAC for "Intent to Cause Harm”:
Issue: "Did the defendant act with intent?"
Rule: "Intent requires a conscious objective to cause harm (e.g., State v. Smith )."
Application: "The defendant’s statement, 'I meant to hit him,' demonstrates intent."
Conclusion: "Intent is proven."
Prioritization: Focus resources on "Intent" first, as it is a critical element with strong evidence.
Example Workflow for a Defense Attorney
Issue Tree:
Main Issue: "Should the case be dismissed for lack of evidence?"
Sub-Issues: "Insufficient Corroboration," "Witness Reliability," "Chain of Custody."
IRAC for "Chain of Custody":
Issue: "Was the evidence properly preserved?"
Rule: "Evidence must maintain an unbroken chain of custody (People v. Kelly )."
Application: "The lab report lacks a signature from the analyst, breaking the chain."
Conclusion: "Evidence is inadmissible."
Prioritization:
Address "Chain of Custody" first to seek dismissal early.
