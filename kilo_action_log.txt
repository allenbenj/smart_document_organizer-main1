I'm going to check the LSP error in Start_edit.py at line 367
I'm going to search for get_agent_manager implementations
I'm going to explain the LSP error to the user
LSP error defined as: Line 367 in Start_edit.py - 'initialize' called on potential None object from get_agent_manager()
I'm going to check if get_agent_manager can return None
I'm going to read the get_agent_manager function from agents/__init__.py
I'm going to explain that get_agent_manager returns a singleton or raises exception, not None
I'm going to conclude LSP error is false positive since GUI works
I'm going to clarify that the 'wall of text' is file content read to verify get_agent_manager behavior
