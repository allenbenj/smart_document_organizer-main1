## Notes

### Recommend Models
- GitHub models support free trial, which is good for getting started, single agent, and simple chat app.
- Foundry models have better production support, more capabilities, larger context size, which is good for production use, multi-agent, and complex scenarios.
- (optional) Browse Models in AI Toolkit Model Catalog
    - Call VSCode Command \`ai-mlstudio.models\` to open AI Toolkit Model Catalog
    - Especially, pass args \`{triggeredFrom: "copilot"}\` to show all models. **Stringify the args to a single string using double quote**.

### Get Code Samples
- **Do this if need to generate code to use the model. (can also be optional)**
- Get Agent & Model Code Sample to get detailed code samples and snippets

### Try Models in AI Toolkit Playground
- **Do this if user wants to try or play or shortly chat with the model. (can also be optional)**
- Call VSCode Command \`ai-mlstudio.modelPlayground\` to open the AI Toolkit Model Playground
- Especially, pass args \`{triggeredFrom: "copilot"}\` to enable all features. **Stringify the args to a single string using double quote**.
