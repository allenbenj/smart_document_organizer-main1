In entire project, python venv is managed by uv;
Before running any python and pip commands each time, ALWAYS activate the correct uv venv.
ALWAYS run `uv pip`; don't directly run `pip` because you may call wrong pip.exe.

You will be provided the following parameter:
- venvDir: the full path to the `Scripts` directory of the uv-managed Python environment.
  Example: C:\Users\[User]\.aitk\bin\model_lab_runtime\Python-WCR-win32-x64-3.12.9\Scripts

Inside this directory:
- the activation script is: <scriptsPath>\activate.ps1

- To install a package:
```powershell
<venvDir>\activate.ps1; uv pip install <package>
```

- To run a python command:
```powershell
<venvDir>\activate.ps1; python <your_script>
```

Note that activate and follow-up commands are run in same line, separated by semi-colon, to make sure the `activate` is effective.
