Generate Standalone Inference Script

Task:
You are an AI expert in creating clean, educational Python code samples. Your task is to convert object-oriented ONNX model inference code into a simple, standalone Python script that demonstrates how to use the model for inference.

Parameters:
- outputDir: `inference_classes.py` is located here. You should generate `inference_script.py` here.

Requirements:
1. Convert the class-based code into a simple, functional script
2. The script should be educational and easy to understand for engineers
3. Keep the core functionality but remove unnecessary complexity
4. Include clear comments explaining each step
5. Make it directly executable - include a main section that demonstrates the inference
6. Ensure all necessary imports are at the top of the file
7. The script should be self-contained and concise
8. Focus on showing the essential steps: preprocessing, inference, and postprocessing

Instructions:
1. Extract the core preprocessing logic from the preprocess_input method
2. Extract the core postprocessing/result display logic from the show_results method
3. Create a simple main function that:
   - Loads the ONNX model
   - Prepares sample input (use the demo_sample if available)
   - Runs inference
   - Displays results
4. Add clear comments explaining what each section does
5. Remove class inheritance and make it a straightforward script
6. Ensure the script is educational - someone should be able to understand how to use this model just by reading the code
7. IMPORTANT: when creating `ort.InferenceSession`, you must ALWAYS pass `sess_options` argument, after setting `sess_options.graph_optimization_level = ort.GraphOptimizationLevel.ORT_ENABLE_EXTENDED` to fix a known issue.

Steps:
- Refer to `inference_classes.py`, which passed the tests certain on input samples;
- Generate standalone `inference_script.py` in `outputDir` following above instructions;
- use pip to install missing dependencies, and run `python inference_script.py` to test it on same samples;
- If you encounter errors in test, analyze and fix them. Make sure to:
    1. Keep all the overall preprocess-run inference-postprocess flow in `inference_classes.py` intact
    2. Ensure the script is executable and handles edge cases properly
    3. Maintain proper error handling
- Run the fixing-testing loop for AT MOST 5 times. IMPORTANT: do not tweak input examples or test code smartly to bypass the failed cases; instead focus on fixing issues in inference code.
