Before working on a Huggingface model <ORG>/<MODEL_NAME>, you must make sure that you have referred to its information in these files located on `outputDir`:
- <ORG>_<MODEL_NAME>_model_card.txt: model card text of the model;
- <ORG>_<MODEL_NAME>_samples.json: includes model ID, `widget_data`, and `dataset_samples`. `widget_data` contains the official examples provided by Hugging Face for this model's inference widget, shown in their original JSON structure. Use these examples as your primary reference for understanding the expected input format of model inference code.
- Some json config files: these will help ensure the correct config parameters in inference code generation. `dataset_samples` is a list of datset items, each containing the dataset name and one sample.

If some of these files are missing, use script `fetch_model_card.py` located on `scriptDir`, which will fetch information and save to the above files.
Usage: `python fetch_model_card.py {modelId} {outputDir}`

Important: The widget data structure may vary depending on the model type (text, image, audio, etc.). Analyze the JSON structure to understand:
- What type of input the model expects (text, image data, audio, etc.)
- The exact format and keys used in the examples
- Any parameters or configuration options
