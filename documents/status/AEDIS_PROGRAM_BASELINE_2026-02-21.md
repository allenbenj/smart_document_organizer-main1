# AEDIS Program Baseline - 2026-02-21

## Baseline Snapshot
- Branch: `main`
- Commit: `b7f185d8f022ed1a64e10227519b6edb553cc96e`
- Tracker: `documents/status/TASKMASTER_TRACKER_AEDIS_CRITICAL_GAPS_2026-02-21.md`

## Working Tree Hygiene
- Repository contains a large pre-existing set of local modifications across many files and folders.
- Two attempts to run full status inventory commands (`git status`, `git ls-files`) stalled in this environment and were terminated.
- No destructive cleanup/revert action was taken.

## Execution Branch Declaration
- Gap-closure execution continues on branch: `main`.
- All tracker updates and implementation artifacts are recorded with dated entries in the tracker Sync Log.

## Status Docs Index Check
- No explicit status index registry file was found under `documents/status/`.
- Action treated as not required; this baseline file serves as the Section 0.1 audit artifact.
