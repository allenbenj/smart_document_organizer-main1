within  his affidavit are actually true.\\nAdditionally, questions concerning the reliability of a witness\\u2019s testimony are not to be decided at the first stage of postconviction proceedings, but 2Again, we remind the State that Hammond\\u2019s failure to specifically 
articulate what exactly he would have testified to at trial does not justify dismissal at first stage.\\nOmission  of  said  facts  was  extremely prejudicial to defendant\\u2019s claim of justification or a finding of murder in a lesser degree at trial.\\nIt was premature and

Deal, expressed in her interview that she was a survivor of domestic violence and rape but insisted she was non-biased.\\nLaw enforcement took her statements seriously without sufficient scrutiny, potentially biasing the investigation against Ben.\\nFor example, Tiffany's claims 
about Ben's character and behavior were not corroborated by evidence, yet they influenced Ben's perception during the investigation.\\nInconsistencies in Lauren Deal's Statements\\n\\n\\nContradictory Accounts: Lauren's statements about the alleged assault are inconsistent.\\nIn her 
police interviews, she indicated that the incident lasted 2-3 minutes and described being held down.\\nHowever, at trial, she mentioned that she was unsure of the duration and implied it might have been shorter.\\nAdditionally, she stated that she had bruises on her arms, but these 
were not visible in the interrogation video or photographs taken at the hospital.\\nThis raises questions about the accuracy of her claims and her reliability as a witness.\\nThe documents indicate that he did not secure bed linens or other potential exculpatory evidence, which 
could have provided crucial information regarding the alleged assault.\\nInstead, he opted only to take photographs of the scene, which is insufficient for a thorough investigation.\\nWitness Interviews: Law enforcement did not interview key witnesses, such as Carmen 
Love.\\nPotential for Coercion and Manipulation\\n\\n\\nExtortion Attempt: The documentation mentions an attempted extortion of $150,000, which was not investigated by law enforcement.\\nThe fact that this extortion was not pursued suggests a failure in the investigative process and 
may indicate that the charges were influenced by ulterior motives.\\nPressure to Plead: The Assistant District Attorney (ADA), Tiffany Bartholomew, allegedly used misleading statements about DNA evidence to pressure Ben into accepting a plea deal.\\nFor example, she claimed to have 
his sperm and insisted that he should take a plea deal, which Ben knew to be false.\\nPhysical Evidence and Forensic Analysis\\n\\n\\nDNA Evidence : The absence of DNA evidence linking Ben to the alleged assault is critical.\\nThe documents indicate that Ben willingly provided his 
DNA, yet no other men who were with Lauren that night were asked for DNA samples.\\nMedical Examination : The lack of visible injuries or bruising on Lauren, as well as the absence of a thorough medical examination, calls into question the validity of her claims.\\nThe documents 
state that medical records were subpoenaed multiple times but were not available on the first day of trial, further complicating the prosecution's case.\\nTimeline Reconstruction\\n\\n\\nDiscrepancies in Timing : The timeline of events as recounted by various witnesses does not 
align.\\nA detailed reconstruction of the timeline based on verifiable evidence is essential to clarify these inconsistencies.\\nThe documents indicate that the detective's prior false testimony was not disclosed, which could provide grounds for dismissing the case or excluding 
certain evidence.\\nFor example, Carmen's testimony about Lauren's behavior and interactions with Ben is inconsistent with other witnesses' accounts, which could be used to undermine her credibility.\\nConclusion\\nThe case against Benjamin S. Allen is riddled with inconsistencies, 
questionable witness credibility, and significant investigative shortcomings.\\nThere is also a required polygraph.\\nThey should have told me immediately about the accusations she was making.\\nThe allegations she made should have been relayed to me so that I could have restricted 
her access to the kids until she either recovered or managed contact under supervision, as was the court's direction during our custody case.\\nIf law enforcement had done the slightest amount of investigation, they would have discovered the compromising situation my children were 
placed in and should have notified me of her accusations so that previous court requirements could have been reinstated for the protection of my children.\\nFOR REFERENCE:\\nBackground - Family Reunification Report 7.30.15 (See attachments)\\nBackground - Benjamin Allen

I turned over the text messages to my attorneys as soon as it happened.\\nMy attorneys didn\\u2019t dispute the prosecutorial misconduct when I was offered a plea deal using false information.\\nWe were told that my sperm and DNA were found and that I was done, so I should just 
accept the plea.\\nInstead of confronting the ADA, he requested that the court pay for a DNA expert.\\nThe ADA later admitted she made a mistake.\\nThis only came out because I refused to return to the courtroom.\\nNo one was looking out for my interest, and my attorneys let the ADA 
abuse her authority.\\nIt was the only way I knew to force my attorneys to handle the situation.\\nThe ADA said it was an honest mistake, and the judge said it didn\\u2019t prejudice my case since the court paid for a DNA expert.\\nA DNA expert who didn\\u2019t even get to testify 
due to the ADA pushing her time, ensuring he would already be gone.\\nIf she offered me that plea as an honest mistake, was the same misrepresentation of the evidence provided to the grand jury?\\nShe missed deadlines without concern and failed to follow through on document 
production, forcing additional delays.\\nI could not present a reasonable defense because evidence was lost during these forced delays.\\nThis was never brought up during my trial.\\nThe prosecution was allowed to present the evidence as if I was trying to hide it.\\nThe attorney to

the court during my trial.\\nThe vast discrepancies between the conversations of the witnesses and the detective and the same witnesses and the private investigator were never brought up to the court.\\nSignificant differences made it apparent that the statements made to the police 
and the private investigator were false.\\nThe discrepancies in the accuser's statements on the stand were not addressed.\\nOnce she testified, it should have been relatively easy to point out how ridiculous this route was if one was running for their life.\\nThis could be combined 
with how she claimed the event occurred.\\nI asked my attorneys when we could press perjury charges since the statements about the event were not physiologically possible.\\nThey also never asked about the hour gap in the timeline that was in the witness testimony.\\nThe fact that 
the other gentlemen with Lauren Deal that night were not interviewed also leads one to suspect the investigation.\\nThere was no concern to detail the night's events to ascertain a solid timeline.\\nThe detective in charge of the investigation had many hours of investigative 
training.\\nHe didn\\u2019t attempt to utilize any of that training to establish an investigation.\\nHe also didn\\u2019t report that on the night he arrested me (after a four-hour investigation) he said he would work with the magistrate to get my bail lowered so I could go

of interest.\\nGiglio v. United States | 405 U.S. 150 (1972)\\nImportance of witness credibility and prosecutorial disclosure.\\nDirectly relates to the impact of a detective's familial relationship on witness testimony.\\nThis relationship could have been used to impeach Carmen 
Love's testimony and challenge the integrity of the investigation.\\nWithholding of video evidence from Schooly's bar that contradicted witness statements.\\nThis video evidence could have been used to challenge the credibility of multiple witnesses and potentially exonerate Mr. 
Allen.\\nExamples include:\\nLauren Deal's testimony contradicting video evidence from the bar.\\n(Best v. Duke University, 337 N.C. 742, 448 S.E.2d 506 (1994))\\nThe lack of thorough investigation, apparent bias, and potential fabrication of evidence suggest malice and lack of 
probable cause.\\nb) Mischaracterization of Witness Statements: The detective's report includes statements allegedly made by witnesses that are contradicted by their actual recorded statements.\\nc) False Representation of DNA Evidence: The ADA misrepresented the presence of Mr. 
Allen's DNA as evidence to pressure him into accepting a plea deal.\\nThis omission is a fundamental flaw in the investigation.\\nb) Neglect of Physical Evidence: The detective did not collect crucial physical evidence from the alleged crime scene, such as bedsheets or other 
potential DNA sources.\\nc) Lack of Timeline Verification: The investigation failed to establish a coherent and verified timeline of events.\\nThe discrepancies in the timeline, particularly the unaccounted hour, were not adequately investigated or explained.\\ne) Failure to Verify 
Accuser's Claims: The detective did not adequately verify Lauren Deal's claims about her movements after leaving Mr. Allen's house.\\nAdditionally, we should consider how cognitive biases, such as confirmation bias and tunnel vision, might have influenced the course of this 
investigation.\\nOverlooked Techniques and Procedures:\\n\\na) Failure to Conduct a Proper Crime Scene Investigation:\\nStandard crime scene investigation procedures were not followed.\\nb) Lack of Forensic Analysis:\\nThere's no indication that proper forensic analysis was 
conducted on the limited evidence that was collected.\\nThis should have included:\\n\\nDNA analysis of any biological evidence\\nToxicology reports to corroborate or refute claims about intoxication levels\\nAnalysis of clothing for transfer evidence\\n\\nc) Failure to Establish a 
Comprehensive Timeline:\\nA detailed timeline of events, corroborated by cell phone records, surveillance footage, and witness statements, was not constructed.\\nd) Neglect of Electronic Evidence:\\nThere's no indication that investigators sought to obtain or analyze electronic 
evidence such as:\\n\\nCell phone records and geolocation data\\nSocial media activity\\nText messages or other communications between involved parties\\n\\ne) Lack of Follow-Up Interviews:\\nKey witnesses were not re-interviewed as new information came to light.\\nFollow-up 
interviews are crucial for clarifying inconsistencies and addressing new questions that arise during an investigation.\\nf) Failure to Use Cognitive Interview Techniques:\\nThere's no evidence that cognitive interview techniques, which are known to elicit more accurate and detailed 
information from witnesses, were employed.\\nb) Physical Evidence: The lack of immediate physical evidence is striking:\\nNo rape kit was performed immediately\\nNo evidence was collected from the alleged crime scene\\nNo visible injuries were documented on Lauren Deal or Ben 
Allen\\nThis absence of physical evidence should have prompted a more thorough investigation before an arrest was made.\\nc) Witness Statements: The statements from other witnesses, particularly Joseph DeMarco and Steve Happel, were not fully consistent with Lauren Deal's 
account.\\nThese discrepancies should have been resolved before determining probable cause.\\nd) Video Evidence: The existence of video evidence from Schooly's bar, which apparently contradicted some aspects of the accuser's story, was not considered in the probable cause 
determination.\\nTimeline Issues:\\nThe timeline presented by Lauren Deal and corroborated by her mother is inconsistent with objective evidence, particularly the hospital video timestamp.\\nThis discrepancy casts doubt on the entire narrative and should have been a red flag in the 
probable cause determination.\\nLack of Corroboration:\\nThe failure to corroborate key aspects of Lauren Deal's story before making an arrest is a significant flaw in the probable cause determination.\\nIgnoring Exculpatory Evidence:\\nThe apparent dismissal of evidence that 
contradicted Lauren Deal's account, such as the video from Schooly's and the statements of other witnesses, is a serious breach of the duty to consider all available evidence in determining probable cause.\\nThis failure to explore other possibilities undermines the validity of the 
probable cause determination.\\nConclusion on Probable Cause:\\nBased on this analysis, it appears that the standard for probable cause was not met in the arrest of Ben Allen.\\nThe investigation was rushed, key evidence was ignored or not sought, and potential biases were not 
accounted for.\\nThe totality of the circumstances, when properly considered, does not support a reasonable belief that Mr. Allen committed the alleged crime.\\nI'll examine this through the lens of both an experienced attorney and detective, looking for key details that could 
justify or undermine probable cause.\\nKey Points from the Interview:\\nBen Allen voluntarily came to the police station for questioning.\\nHe expresses concern about potential neglect charges for not looking for Lauren in the woods.\\nIn this interview, there's no direct admission 
of criminal conduct.\\nHis concern about neglect charges suggests awareness something may have happened after leaving the bar, but he doesn't provide details about events at his house.\\nThe interview alone does not appear to provide sufficient grounds for arrest on sexual assault 
charges.\\nA thorough review of the complete case file, including Lauren's statement and any physical evidence, would be necessary to make a definitive assessment of probable cause.\\nTransparency: The detective doesn't clearly communicate to Ben Allen that he's a suspect in a 
potential crime.\\nVoluntariness: While Allen came to the station voluntarily, the detective doesn't make it clear that Allen is free to leave at any time.\\nHe's not fully respecting Allen's autonomy or right to informed consent in the interrogation process.\\nFor instance, Gates 
was accused of [describe the incident], where [key events].\\nOn 12/01/2014, the three older children denied that their father had touched them.\\nMother was instructed by DSS not to take children to any more medical and/or mental health providers and that she should not talk about 
the case to the children and she should not talk about case in their presence.\\nLaw enforcement was unable to listen to lengthy recording mother had made.\\nRecording was very unclear.\\nAccording to Dr. Matala in her CFE Report, the private detective believed that the recording 
was inconclusive for sexual abuse.\\nNone of the children made disclosures of sexual abuse to Dr. Matala.\\nChildren's  statements  different than disclosure to SW Anderson.\\nDuring investigation, Tiffany Allen has changed statements as to details in the case.\\nSarah Allen had 
knowledge of family life because she spent approximately five weeks on and off with the family during the investigation\\nCase substantiated   4-9-15\\nNeglect - injurious environment, improper care, improper discipline, improper supervision with LCDSS interventions

was making.\\nThe allegations she made should have been relayed to me so that I could have restricted her access to the kids until she either recovered or managed contact under supervision, as was the court's direction during our custody case.\\nIf law enforcement had done the 
slightest amount of investigation, they would have discovered the compromising situation my children were placed in and should have notified me of her accusations so that previous court requirements could have been reinstated for the protection of my children.\\nFOR

because it was impossible.\\nYou applied for an expert instead of calling out her misconduct, and you still didn\\u2019t do it when we were sitting in court.\\nThe Assistant District Attorney (ADA) acknowledged, in the presence of a judge and two attorneys, that she offered me a 
plea deal based on a \\u201cmisunderstanding\\u201d of the evidence.\\nThe reason I laid out her qualifications above is due to this statement of misunderstanding the evidence.\\nThis admission raises serious concerns: if the ADA was indeed mistaken about the evidence, it suggests 
that the same incorrect information was used to secure my indictment.\\nAlternatively, if there was no mistake about the evidence, the ADA's actions could constitute deceitful conduct, warranting sanctions.\\nShe stated that the evidence against me was irrefutable.\\nShe noted that

false information.\\nThe ADA admits to a mistake in her evaluation of the facts underlying the plea deal, and the judge's decision that it did not prejudice the case is significant.\\nThe judge's decision that the ADA's error does not prejudice the case suggests that, in his view,

that the ADA's error did not prejudice the case is contentious, primarily because it is a straightforward method of prejudicing someone who does not have a job and no income.\\nShe had already extended the case for years.\\nFraming the situation in this manner and using it to add an

going with Ben.\\u201d\\nMateriality: The State uses this claim to assert coordinated, voluntary movement and continuity of company\\u2014critically shaping probable-cause inferences (e.g., identity of companions, opportunity, continuity, and alleged incapacitation 
narrative).\\nValidation: The 2:00 a.m. statement goes to the heart of who went where and with whom; it\\u2019s not collateral.\\nKnowledge: The prosecution knew of the 12:41 a.m. departure and failed to correct Deal\\u2019s testimony so Napue/Giglio is implicated.\\nUnbiased video 
footage backs this assessment.\\nIt is a concerted effort to build a provably false narrative, as evidenced by video footage.\\nNo one said they were sitting around a fire, and no one said that the defendant followed her inside.\\nFact Note: Lauren Deal testified that the defendant 
never said a word to her.\\nThat the defendant didn\\u2019t speak a single word.\\nFact Note: The allegation was physically impossible, and any competent investigation should have recognized that immediately.\\nThe scenario described was not just unlikely\\u2014it defied the 
fundamental limits of human ability.\\nTo proceed in the face of such apparent impossibility is not diligence; it is willful disregard for the truth.\\nIf true, and the hospital didn\\u2019t report the incident to law enforcement, this failure to report would constitute a

stamps at the bar, a map with driving directions and time, and the time stamps on the video her\\u00a0mother took bound the time in a way that witnesses' testimony cannot.\\nThey tried to extort me for $150,000, but their own \\\"evidence\\\" is what makes the story they are telling 
so obviously false.\\nThe only fact pattern that fits is what I\\u00a0said from the beginning.\\nIt isn't possible because it is another example of questions a Detective would have asked to ascertain the\\u00a0veracity of eyewitness testimony.\\nThere are\\u00a0multiple examples 
besides the one above that he should have picked up on as lies\\u00a0- but he had to already know that.\\n(This is important later)\\nIn his testimony - Did you arrest anybody in connection with the rape Ms. Deal reported?\\nAfter the interview, proceeded to find the magistrate, 
gave probable cause, and the magistrate issued a warrant for Benjamin Allen.\\nWhat was this probable Cause?\\nHe arrested me, fingerprinted me, then said he would talk to the magistrate about bail (getting it lowered), and then he left.\\nShe is the one who stated to Tiffany that 
it didn't matter if I was guilty; she had already talked to her people at the sheriff's office, and I was going down even if I was innocent.\\nIt echoes the officer that said it was their job to make sure I was guilty.\\nHe did not bother to check a single piece of evidence he was 
given.\\nHer later interview with the Private Investigator is completely unhinged.\\nThe evidence is to the contrary.\\nWhy isn\\u2019t she charged with obstruction?\\nThis should have led to allegations of bias in the investigation, undermining its integrity.\\nImpact: The defense 
could have argued that the investigation was compromised, possibly leading to a motion to dismiss evidence or the entire case.\\nThe prosecution might need to reassign the case to another Detective to mitigate this issue if they continue to pursue it.\\nRelationship Between the 
Accuser and the Witness:\\nLegal Aspect: The familial relationship between the accuser and the witness (cousins) doesn't inherently discredit the witness's testimony but could be portrayed as a source of bias.\\nImpact: The defense could have used this relationship to challenge the 
witness's credibility, suggesting they might be inclined to support the accuser regardless of the facts.\\nThe selective focus on inconsistencies that strengthen the accusations while not interviewing two other possible witnesses because one was dating Ms. Love, the other was her 
friend, and an employee of the county goes beyond creating questions of investigative integrity.\\nIt raises questions about the motives and credibility of the accuser's claims.\\nThe defense might have used this to suggest that the assault claim was part of a scheme to extract 
money from the defendant.\\nThe defendant's defense attorney refused even to mention the extortion scheme that was used against his client.\\nThe relationship between the Detective and the witness should have been disclosed, and steps should have been taken to ensure an impartial 
investigation.\\nThe defendant\\u2019s private investigator was told not to plan an attempt to uncover the scheme further.\\nThis decision was made by the defendant's attorney without consulting his client.\\nThe defendant began questioning why the extortion wasn\\u2019t exposed to 
the court or law enforcement.\\nDisclosure and Transparency: Full disclosure of the familial relationships and criminal actions that underpin this case should have been exposed to the court.\\nReevaluation of the Case: The prosecution may need to reevaluate the strength of the case 
considering these developments of she wasn\\u2019t already aware of them.\\nThe report meticulously outlines instances that suggest a preconceived narrative of guilt rather than an impartial pursuit of truth, underscoring the severity of the situation.\\nThese interviews presented 
stark inconsistencies.\\nHer initial interview omitted any mention of assault and focused solely on social interactions.\\nCarmen stated that she had never heard the defendant\\u2019s name.\\nIt was not explained how the detective utilized her statements as part of his probable 
cause, since she had never even heard his name, even though that is what he testified to during the trial.\\nSelective Witness Interviewing: The intentional failure to interview Peter West and James Morrison, individuals present with the accuser on the night in question and 
possessing potentially exculpatory information, is not just negligent, but strategically harmful to a fair investigation.\\nThe omission of these witnesses suggests a deliberate attempt to control the narrative and suppress potentially contradictory evidence, further highlighting 
the injustice.\\nHis claim to have \\\"processed\\\" the crime scene while admitting to taking no DNA, fingerprint, or biological samples beyond mere photographs is a blatant misrepresentation.\\nThese are not minor discrepancies, but material misrepresentations used to secure a 
search warrant.\\nThese false statements concealed the weakness of the prosecution's case and suppressed information favorable to the defense.\\nThe false representation of witness statements was found only after careful review of audio recordings.\\nFurthermore, the failure to 
disclose the familial relationship with Carmen Love is a\\u00a0Brady\\u00a0violation, as it constitutes impeachment evidence directly relevant to witness credibility.\\nThe fact that her subpoena was not enforced confirms the belief that her untruthful statements could not stand 
against any sort of examination of the facts.\\nConflicting Accounts and Delayed Hospital Transfer Inconsistencies in Testimony: Lauren Deal and her mother\\u2019s account of leaving CCH immediately for another hospital conflicts with testimony indicating they waited for someone to 
bring them personal items from nearly an hour away.\\nThis discrepancy shows they stayed at CCH longer than reported, during which time hospital staff would have contacted law enforcement.\\nThis conflicting narrative undermines the credibility of Deal\\u2019s and her mother\\u2019s 
testimony, raising questions about what transpired during their time at CCH.\\nLaw enforcement's arrival at CCH contradicts the narrative presented by Deal and her mother, indicating that additional undisclosed events or agreements may have influenced the case\\u2019s initial 
handling.\\nImplications for Law Enforcement Involvement: Law enforcement was contacted upon Deal\\u2019s arrival at CCH, and a decision was made not to record or investigate the report at that time.\\nPotential Legal Violations and Obstruction of Justice\\nWithholding 911 Records 
and Reports:\\nThe refusal to provide 911 records or incident reports for that night is concerning.\\nThis lack of transparency raises suspicion and shows that evidence of the hospital\\u2019s and law enforcement\\u2019s initial response is being deliberately 
concealed.\\nMisrepresentation of DNA Evidence: The ADA's misrepresentation of DNA evidence and injury to the accuser during plea negotiations, falsely claiming the defendant's sperm was found and clear physical injury, is a blatant act of prosecutorial 
misconduct.\\nCross-Examination Deficiencies: \\u00a0The defense attorneys' alleged failure to cross-examine key witnesses effectively, particularly regarding inconsistencies and potential biases, represents a significant dereliction of duty.\\nFurthermore, the failure to adequately 
investigate extortion claims, which could have provided exculpatory evidence or revealed alternative motives, demonstrates a lack of diligence and advocacy.\\nFor the record, it says \\\"your honor, we unanimously agree defendant is not guilty of first-degree forcible rape.\\nThis 
note explicitly stated, \\\"your honor, we unanimously agree defendant is not guilty of first-degree forcible rape.\\\"\\nIn this case, that tribunal reached a definitive conclusion of not guilty regarding the first-degree rape charge.\\nGiven this expertise, his actions and 
omissions should be viewed with an understanding that he likely knew the standard requirements yet chose specific approaches in this investigation that appear to deviate from standard protocol.\\nHowever, the timestamp is questionable.\\nThe defendant still hasn\\u2019t seen the 
messages from Carmen Love.\\nThis video falsely verifies aspects of Deal\\u2019s story while ignoring all instances that showed that the accuser committed perjury.\\nThe pants were seized and logged into evidence.\\nStill, they were not sent to the crime lab.\\nThis suggests he was 
aware he was under suspicion and that legal actions were in process.\\nIn legal proceedings, the defense could argue that this omission deprived Allen of his Fourth Amendment rights, as he was detained without a clear, documented basis.\\nThis doubt cast a shadow over his testimony, 
particularly if the defense argues that he knowingly avoided documentation to circumvent procedural scrutiny.\\nIt shows significant disregard for standard protocols, raising serious questions about his methods and tainting the investigation.\\nHowever, verbal assertions without 
supporting documentation do not meet procedural standards and fail to provide a reliable, reviewable record.\\nIt raises questions about the standard procedures he followed and testified to in this case.\\nHis familiarity with both should have allowed him to recognize and clearly 
articulate this distinction during his testimony.\\nHis testimony avoidance is an attempt to evade admitting procedural missteps.\\nThe defense could argue that this omission suggests a pattern of neglecting legal protocols, which might prompt further investigation into other areas 
of the case.\\nHis failure to follow these steps suggests either an intentional bypass of procedure or a significant oversight.\\nHowever, this is inconsistent with his professional knowledge, implying that the deviation was either deliberate or based on a disregard for 
protocol.\\nHowever, the lack of clarity in his responses still raises questions about whether he understood the retrospective order as a form of procedural cover, despite knowing it bypassed the usual review process.\\nGiven his role as an instructor, this omission seems unlikely 
to be unintentional and may indicate an awareness of procedural shortcuts.\\nEvidence as Objective Corroboration: Unlike testimonial evidence, which can be subjective or challenged based on credibility, physical evidence provides objective data that can confirm or contradict witness 
statements or suspects\\u2019 claims.\\nThis record is essential to establishing that the evidence remained unaltered and that all handling was conducted according to protocol.\\nThis omission could raise questions about whether the evidence was consistently handled according to 
protocol, making it vulnerable to defense scrutiny.\\nAny missteps or procedural shortcuts in handling evidence could reflect poorly on his overall investigative process.\\nThis line of questioning could further erode his reliability in the eyes of the jury or judge.\\nHowever, 
without a documented statement, this verbal presentation lacks the reviewability and accountability of a formal affidavit and is unlikely to meet standard legal requirements.\\nWithout a written affidavit or documented justification, the probable cause assessment lacks a clear, 
reviewable basis.\\nYou said:\\nGo over the entire document and compare his testimony to the ADA and teh testimony to Mr. Cruz.\\nThis response emphasized his interpretation that Allen\\u2019s freedom was not restricted during their interaction.\\nCruz questioned if other factors 
like being alone with an officer could constitute custody.\\nEvasiveness in Testimony Regarding Custody Timing\\nADA Bartholomew\\u2019s Examination:\\nBartholomew\\u2019s questioning did not explicitly address the timing of Allen\\u2019s custody, focusing instead on whether Miranda 
rights were issued and the procedural aspects of evidence collection.\\nThere is no probable cause affidavit for arrest.\\nBy adding interpretations or facts not supported by the witness testimony, he potentially misled the magistrate into issuing a search warrant based on distorted 
or unsupported claims.\\nThis could lead to the suppression of any evidence obtained through the search.\\nBy inserting a narrative that was not in witness statements, he may have demonstrated a predisposition toward a particular outcome in the investigation, compromising his 
neutrality.\\nWithout this documentation, there is no verifiable record to support the legal grounds for detaining Allen.\\nAny deviation from these statements can be seen as either a misunderstanding or an intentional misrepresentation.\\nThis omission denies a clear record of the 
arrest\\u2019s justification, raising due process concerns.\\nYou said:\\nHe was a close family member of one of the witnesses.\\nNon-disclosure of such a connection could severely impact the credibility of his investigation and might even lead to claims of bias, conflict of 
interest, or investigative misconduct.\\nHere\\u2019s an in-depth look at the implications of this undisclosed relationship and how it might affect the case:\\n\\n1.\\nFailure to disclose a close relationship with a witness could suggest a lack of impartiality.\\nThis lack of 
transparency could lead the court or jury to question his integrity and impartiality, which are crucial to his role as an investigator.\\nThis could further erode his credibility, making his entire testimony appear suspect.\\nCourts may consider excluding evidence if it can be shown 
that the investigator\\u2019s personal connections influenced how the evidence was collected, documented, or presented.\\nThey could question him on whether his personal connection affected his decision-making and why he didn\\u2019t inform the department of this relationship from 
the outset.\\nThis undisclosed relationship raises questions about his objectivity and may suggest investigational bias.\\nYou said:\\nHe never reviewed the bar video until 4 years later at trial.\\nThe video showed many deviations from witness statements and testimony.\\nShe also 
testified to this at trial.\\nThis is provably false by the video.\\nThese discrepancies indicate potential failures in investigative diligence and reliability of key witness testimony, particularly regarding interactions between Lauren Deal and Mr. Allen.\\nVideo evidence from 
Schooly\\u2019s bar would have been one of the most objective sources of information available to corroborate or challenge witness accounts, making it critical to the investigation\\u2019s accuracy and completeness.\\nThe absence of video review at the time could suggest a lack of 
due process, as the decision to arrest and pursue charges appears to have been based solely on unverified statements.\\nDiscrepancies in Witness Statements vs. Video Evidence\\nContradictions in Lauren Deal\\u2019s Statements:\\nInitial Interaction with Mr. Allen: Lauren Deal 
claimed that she ran up and hugged Mr. Allen when she first saw him at the bar, and they sat around talking.\\nThis false narrative, repeated both in her interview and in court testimony, undermines her credibility as it is provably false.\\nThis false statement undermines 
Deal\\u2019s testimony about Allen\\u2019s intentions and character, misrepresenting his role that evening.\\nThis contradiction indicates that her account of the night\\u2019s events was either mistaken or intentionally fabricated.\\nInflated Narrative to Justify Probable Cause: 
The affidavit\\u2019s inaccuracies point to a potential embellishment to support probable cause where evidence was otherwise insufficient.\\nThe defense could argue that these inaccuracies indicate investigative bias or even misconduct, seeking to exclude any evidence obtained under 
the false pretense of probable cause.\\nConsequences for Witness Credibility and Defense Leverage\\nChallenging Deal\\u2019s Credibility: The defense now has strong grounds to impeach Deal\\u2019s testimony based on objective evidence from the video, which contradicts her statements 
and trial testimony.\\nThese inconsistencies could significantly weaken the prosecution\\u2019s case if the jury finds her untrustworthy or unreliable.\\nDeal\\u2019s provable falsehoods about her interactions with Allen and others directly impact the prosecution\\u2019s narrative, 
as her statements form the basis of the charges.\\nHis willingness to proceed without verifying key evidence suggests a potentially biased investigation that may have favored Deal\\u2019s version of events without scrutiny.\\nDefense Leverage on Witness Credibility: The video 
evidence contradicting Deal\\u2019s statements and testimony provides strong grounds for the defense to impeach her credibility, potentially undermining the prosecution\\u2019s case if the jury doubts her reliability.\\nThere were no identifying marks to say these pants were the 
accusers.\\nThere was no proof as to how they got there.\\nIs it normal during an investigation not to have the pants verified as the accusers?\\nWhy wouldn't the DA ask that they be verified?\\nFailure to confirm that the black pants belonged to the alleged victim, especially when 
the investigator himself admits there were \\\"no identifying marks,\\\" represents a significant gap in investigative rigor.\\nIn this situation, the black pants could be critical in corroborating the alleged victim's account of the events, especially given their presence at the 
suspect\\u2019s residence.\\nIdentification of Evidence Ownership: Properly identifying and verifying that the pants belonged to the alleged victim would provide the prosecution with concrete support for their narrative, reinforcing that Deal was indeed at Allen\\u2019s residence 
and potentially strengthening her credibility.\\nWithout verification that the pants belonged to Deal, their evidentiary value is questionable, as there is no proof that they were tied to her or the alleged events.\\nFailing to confirm that the pants belonged to the alleged victim 
could violate chain of custody principles, as the pants\\u2019 relevance is not established, and their connection to the victim remains speculative.\\nWithout this confirmation, the pants lack the evidentiary foundation required for admissibility and reliability in court.\\nWithout 
verification, the pants become circumstantial at best, potentially leading the jury to question why critical evidence was left unexamined.\\nWithout verification, the DA risks relying on unsubstantiated claims about the pants, potentially introducing doubt about the thoroughness and 
integrity of the investigation.\\nDefense Leverage from Non-Verification\\nChallenge to Evidence Relevance: The defense can argue that the pants have no established connection to the case, as there is no proof they belonged to Deal or arrived at Allen\\u2019s residence under 
circumstances relevant to the allegations.\\nQuestioning Investigative Diligence and Bias: The defense may claim that the lack of verification reflects a bias in the investigation, suggesting that the police and prosecution accepted Deal\\u2019s narrative without scrutinizing 
critical details, such as whether the pants were indeed hers.\\n\\u25cb Inadequate collection of evidence.\\n\\u25cb Lack of witness interviews.\\nSteve Happel reported that he was called on the phone by the prosecutor and the detective telling him that he knew the defendant was 
guilty.\\nSteve Happel testified to the facts of the case and not the narrative that was being presented by the prosecution.\\nFor example, he testified that the keys were handed to DeMarco while Lauren Deal testified that she gave them to Ben Allen.\\nStandard investigative ethics 
require that officers disclose any pre-existing relationships with witnesses to avoid perceived or actual bias.\\nImplications of Non-Disclosure:\\nNon-disclosure of connections with witnesses can be grounds for questioning the objectivity of the investigation.\\nAltering statements 
without witness verification is a serious breach of investigative ethics and could amount to falsification, particularly if changes were made to fit a preconceived narrative.\\nThese discrepancies provide grounds for the defense to challenge the validity of the probable cause 
affidavit, potentially leading to motions to suppress evidence obtained from the search.\\nThese omissions suggest procedural neglect, as any uncollected evidence or unprotected scenes could introduce doubt about the accuracy of the investigation and the reliability of the findings 
presented in court.\\nAdditionally, his failure to interview or collect statements from other potential witnesses reflects an incomplete investigation.\\nAdditionally, Deal\\u2019s claim that Happel was the \\u201cdrunkest that night\\u201d contradicts video evidence showing he 
drank the least, indicating a possible intent to discredit him.\\nHappel\\u2019s testimony contradicted Deal\\u2019s narrative in several respects, including who held Deal\\u2019s keys (DeMarco, not Allen) and other events that night.\\nImplications for Investigation and 
Trial:\\nComments that reveal bias against a witness undermine the perceived impartiality of the investigation, especially if they target a witness providing testimony that doesn\\u2019t align with the prosecution.\\nThese lapses suggest investigative bias and a lack of adherence to 
standard investigative protocols.\\nThese gaps could provide strong grounds for the defense to argue that the investigation was biased and incomplete.\\nConflicting Accounts and Delayed Hospital Transfer\\nInconsistencies in Testimony:\\nLauren Deal and her mother\\u2019s account of 
leaving CCH immediately for another hospital conflicts with testimony indicating they waited for someone to bring them personal items from nearly an hour away.\\nThis conflicting narrative undermines the credibility of Deal\\u2019s and her mother\\u2019s testimony, as it raises 
questions about what actually transpired during their time at CCH.\\nIf law enforcement did indeed arrive at CCH, this would contradict the narrative presented by Deal and her mother, indicating that additional undisclosed events or agreements may have influenced the case\\u2019s 
initial handling.\\nPotential Legal Violations and Obstruction of Justice\\nWithholding 911 Records and Reports:\\nThe refusal to provide 911 records or incident reports for that night is concerning.\\nThis lack of transparency raises suspicion and could suggest that evidence of the 
hospital\\u2019s and law enforcement\\u2019s initial response is being deliberately concealed.\\nConflicting Narratives and Credibility Issues: Discrepancies in the timeline, such as Deal and her mother\\u2019s claim of leaving CCH immediately versus waiting for personal items to be 
delivered, cast doubt on the credibility of their account and suggest that undisclosed events may have influenced the initial response.\\n--- FILE: E:/Organization_Folder/02_Working_Folder/02_Analysis/06_Case Review\\\\Legal Outline - Ben Allen Case.docx ---\\nBen Allen Legal

Inconsistencies: Witness Credibility Issues\\nEvolving Truth:\\u00a0Carmen Love's interviews presented stark inconsistencies.\\nHer initial interview omitted any mention of assault, focusing solely on social interactions.\\nCarmen said that she had never heard the defendant\\u2019s 
name.\\nSudden Assault Account:\\u00a0A subsequent interview dramatically shifted, introducing detailed accounts of an assault, raising red flags about the veracity and reliability of her statements.\\nEvidence Fabrication:\\u00a0Statements within the interviews display the 
willingness to fabricate evidence, further undermining the witness's credibility and the investigation.\\nMisrepresentation of DNA Evidence:\\u00a0The ADA misrepresented DNA evidence, misleading the court and the jury.\\nSelective Witness Interviewing:\\u00a0Witness interviews were 
conducted selectively to create a biased narrative, neglecting potentially exculpatory information.\\nAccuser Statement Reliability Issues:\\u00a0Concerns exist regarding the reliability of accusers' statements used as primary evidence.\\nEvidence Verification Failures: Lack of 
Scrutiny\\nUnverified Accuser Claims:\\u00a0The detective failed to adequately verify the accuser's claims regarding movements after the alleged incident.\\nPhysical Layout Contradiction:\\u00a0Physical evidence and the crime scene layout contradicted the accuser's account, yet 
these discrepancies were not thoroughly investigated.\\nFailure to Cross-Examine:\\u00a0Defense attorneys failed to cross-examine key witnesses, missing critical opportunities to challenge testimony.\\nThe defense did not question why witnesses such as Carmen Love were not present 
at the trial.\\nExtortion Claims Ignored:\\u00a0Defense counsel did not adequately investigate extortion claims, overlooking potentially exculpatory avenues.\\nImproper Forensic Evidence:\\u00a0Improper or extremely weak forensic evidence was presented, failing to meet evidentiary 
standards.\\nEyewitness Identification Errors:\\u00a0Potential errors in eyewitness identification were not adequately addressed, contributing to the flawed process.\\nBrady Violations\\nFailure to Correct Known False Testimony\\nThe ADA repeatedly refused to correct testimony known 
to be false, explicitly violating the prosecutors' constitutional obligation to rectify perjured testimony.\\nPersistent refusal to rectify perjured testimony directly contravenes this standard.\\nThere was no apparent reason for the detective to read this statement as Hoskins was

undermining the reliability of testimony.\\nSelective focus on evidence that supported the accuser's allegations.\\nHospital Video Timestamp Manipulation\\nTimeline Evidence Alteration: Potential Cover-Up\\nTimestamp Misrepresentation:\\u00a0Detective Freeman appears to have 
deliberately misrepresented the timestamp of a hospital video, claiming it was recorded at 3:42 AM when metadata indicated a creation time of 2:42 AM.\\nCritical Timeline Discrepancy:\\u00a0This one-hour discrepancy is crucial to the timeline of events and raises concerns 
about:\\nPotential manipulation of evidence to fit a predetermined narrative.\\nFabricated Assault and False Allegations\\nConspiracy to Create False Narrative: Deceptive Scheme\\nAssault Fabrication:\\u00a0Evidence suggests the alleged sexual assault was fabricated and part of a 
coordinated deceptive scheme involving multiple individuals.\\nConspiracy Elements:\\u00a0This conspiracy included:\\nThe evolution of the story over time indicates a constructed narrative.\\nInconsistent and changing narratives between interviews, highlighting 
fabrication.\\nFinancial Motivation for False Accusations\\nAttempted Bribery Evidence: Financial Gain Incentive\\nBribery Attempt:\\u00a0Evidence emerged of a mutual friend offering a substantial bribe ($15,000 per year for 10 years) to make the case \\\"go away,\\\" suggesting 
financial motivation behind the allegations.\\nAccuser's Financial Circumstances:\\u00a0The accuser's circumstances as a single mother recently evicted from her boyfriend's residence provided a plausible financial motive for fabricating the assault claim to secure financial 
benefits.\\nFalse Evidence Claims:\\u00a0The ADA falsely claimed:\\nLab results identified the defendant's DNA/sperm, which was untrue.\\nEvidence of damage to the victim\\u2019s vagina was evident, also untrue.\\nDeliberate Misrepresentation:\\u00a0These false claims constitute 
deliberate misrepresentation, likely used to secure the indictment from the Grand Jury based on fabricated information.\\nTime Gap in the Investigation Timeline\\nUnexplained Critical Timeline Void: Investigative Neglect\\nUninvestigated Time Gap:\\u00a0The detective or attorneys 
never investigated a significant, unexplained one-hour gap in the timeline of events, representing a critical oversight.\\nPotential Lost Evidence:\\u00a0This time gap could potentially contain crucial, unexamined information that is highly relevant to the case.\\nThe evidence 
points to this being a fabrication that should have been investigated by the defense and the district attorney\\u2019s office.\\nInconsistent Hospital Timeline\\nDeliberate Timeline Manipulation: Deception Indicated\\nHospital Timeline Discrepancies:\\u00a0Major discrepancies exist 
regarding Lauren's arrival times at Central Carolina Hospital (CCH) and UNC Hospital, suggesting deliberate timeline manipulation.\\nUnexplained Two-Hour Gap:\\u00a0An unexplained two-hour period remains unaccounted for, raising suspicions of deliberate deception or concealment of 
critical events during this period.\\nSecurity camera timestamps, video footage, and official documents contradict witness accounts of the timeline.\\nContradictory Video Evidence Ignored\\nExculpatory Surveillance Footage: Evidence Disregarded\\nVideo Evidence 
Contradiction:\\u00a0Video evidence from Schooly's bar directly contradicted witness statements, yet law enforcement or prosecution did not properly investigate or acknowledge this crucial contradiction.\\nThe contradictory statements and other exaggerations were put into an 
affidavit to provide the illusion of guilt.\\nExculpatory Potential:\\u00a0This video evidence had the potential to significantly challenge the credibility of multiple witnesses and potentially exonerate the defendant, yet was ignored.\\nMisrepresentation of Evidence in the Opening 
Statement\\nMisleading Jury with False Information: Ethical Breach\\nOpening Statement Misrepresentation:\\u00a0The ADA misrepresented DNA evidence to the jury during her opening statement.\\nRehearsed Witness Testimony\\nCoordinated Witness Preparation: Authenticity 
Compromised\\nRehearsed Testimonies:\\u00a0Evidence suggests that Lauren and her mother's testimonies appeared rehearsed, indicating potential witness coaching and manipulation of their accounts.\\nWitness Coaching:\\u00a0Witness Steve Happel's account details, observing Lauren 
receiving explicit coaching for her testimony, raising severe concerns about the authenticity and reliability of their statements.\\nMissing and Lost Phone Evidence\\nCritical Evidence Not Preserved: Evidence Handling Failure\\nLost Phone and Data:\\u00a0The legal team was entrusted 
with a phone and an expert\\u2019s fee of  $5,000 to extract data from a telephone containing potentially exculpatory text messages, but the phone and the extracted data have been irretrievably lost.\\nSecond Interview Contradictions from Carmen Love\\nDramatically Changed Story 
Between Interviews: Witness Deception\\nFirst Interview Denial:\\u00a0In her first interview with Detective Freeman, Carmen Love explicitly denied knowing Ben Allen when directly asked.\\nSecond Interview Reversal:\\u00a0In a subsequent interview with a private investigator, Carmen 
Love completely contradicted her initial statements, claiming extensive interaction and conversation with Ben Allen at the bar.\\nThis complete reversal in testimony indicates deliberate deception and potential witness tampering or coordination.\\nCarmen Love's Undisclosed Survivor 
Status Impact\\nBiased Witness with Undisclosed Motivations: Impartiality Questioned\\nUndisclosed Bias:\\u00a0In her second interview, Carmen Love revealed she is a survivor of domestic violence and rape, a critical detail not disclosed in her first interview with law 
enforcement.\\nUnexplored Bias:\\u00a0This undisclosed background created a significant and unexamined bias that was never explored or considered during the official investigation, potentially influencing her testimony and perceptions.\\nYet, this video was not documented in initial 
reports or used as evidence for issuing an arrest warrant.\\nChain of Custody Neglect:\\u00a0Despite lacking any documented chain of custody, this video evidence was later introduced during court proceedings, raising serious questions about its authenticity and 
admissibility.\\nInconsistent Records Timing:\\u00a0The timing of hospital records appears inconsistent with the physical timeline of events, suggesting potential manipulation or improper maintenance of official medical records.\\nMissing 911 Records\\nCritical Emergency Records Not 
Provided: Transparency Issues\\nNon-Disclosure of 911 Records:\\u00a0The failure to release 911 records and other relevant documentation from the alleged incident creates valid grounds for questioning the integrity and validity of the initial investigation.\\nSystematic 
Failures:\\u00a0Basic investigative steps that should have been routinely taken based on his training and experience were repeatedly and demonstrably ignored throughout this investigation, indicating gross incompetence or deliberate misconduct.\\nInitial interviews with Deal and 
Love reveal inconsistencies (e.g., Love denies knowing Allen, and no mention of any invitation by the defendant).\\nDNA swab consented by Allen; no incriminating results.\\nExtortion allegations surface (~$150,000 demanded).\\nVideo evidence contradicts statements but is restricted 
in presentation.\\nHe also gave inconsistent testimony on the arrest process.10\\nFailure to Establish Probable Cause: No affidavit or notes documented probable cause; reliance on uncorroborated, contradictory statements (e.g., Deal's account biomechanically implausible; Love's 
initial contradictions).\\nElements like Allen's presence, Deal's screaming, and denial fall short of \\\"fair probability\\\" of guilt.11\\nKey Witness Identities and Connections\\nPeter West: Present with Lauren Deal at bars; father employed by the Sheriff's Department; local 
government inspector; connections to the Sheriff and magistrate.12\\nJames Morrison: Carmen Love's boyfriend; city government employee since 2010; similar justice system connections; close ties to Detective Freeman.13\\nFamilial Relationship and Witness Omissions: Detective Freeman, 
related to witness Carmen Love, did not interview Peter West or James Morrison despite their presence and potential relevance.\\nHis testimony denied knowledge of them, contradicting available evidence (e.g., photos, local common knowledge).\\nThis omission could have deprived the 
defense of information regarding the accuser's intoxication and behavior, thereby violating Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963).\\nThis dereliction suggests bad faith under Arizona v. Youngblood, 488 U.S. 51 (1988).16\\nProsecutorial Misconduct\\nThe ADA's conduct raises concerns 
about fairness, including potential misrepresentations and delays.17\\nMisrepresentation of DNA Evidence: The ADA allegedly misrepresented DNA evidence in plea talks and added an aggravating factor post-refusal, potentially constituting coercive tactics under the Fourteenth 
Amendment.\\nWitness statements (e.g., Carmen Love's) evolved, raising credibility questions (e.g., from denial to detailed familiarity).18\\nSelective Witness Interviewing and Procedural Abuse: Excessive 37 continuances over four years caused undue hardship (e.g., lost phone data, 
witness memory fade, economic impact on Allen).\\nContradictions in Deal's account (e.g., impossible escape, no woods/run, 75% illumination vs. \\\"pitch black\\\") not examined.24\\nAccuser Statement Reliability: Initial focus on \\\"feet hurt,\\\" not assault; no \\\"rape\\\" 
mentioned.\\nContradicted by video (e.g., no pre-departure interaction with Allen).25\\nChain of Custody Problems: Documents replaced at trial; edited witness statements (e.g., Hoskins') violated hearsay rules and Confrontation Clause under Crawford v. Washington, 541 U.S. 36 
(2004).26\\nUnverified Claims: Deal's outrunning fit soldiers implausible; physical layout contradictions ignored.27\\nDefense Representation Issues\\nThe defendant suffered from ineffective assistance, undermining fair defense under Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 
(1984).28\\nFailure to Cross-Examine: No questioning on Love's absence or inconsistencies.\\nExtortion Claims Ignored: Private detective ordered not to pursue $150,000 demand.\\nLoss of Data: Phone records with exculpatory info lost; initial interviews vanished.\\nThese failures 
prejudiced the outcome, as post-trial juror feedback indicated that knowledge of the extortion attempt would have led to immediate acquittal.\\nDisclosure must occur timely manner; here, it did not.29\\nTypes: Negating guilt (e.g., video contradictions); impeachment (e.g., 
conflicts); discrediting police (e.g., Freeman's perjury).\\nEconomic and Emotional Harm\\nSignificant Prejudice: Loss of income, job termination, emotional distress to family; witness memory loss.\\nNo conviction occurred, and retrial may be unwarranted given weaknesses.\\nFrom

as soon as it happened.\\nMy attorneys didn\\u2019t dispute the prosecutorial misconduct when I was offered a plea deal using false information.\\nWe were told that my sperm and DNA were found and that I was done, so I should just accept the plea.\\nInstead of confronting the ADA, 
he requested that the court pay for a DNA expert.\\nThe ADA later admitted she made a mistake.\\nThis only came out because I refused to return to the courtroom.\\nNo one was looking out for my interest, and my attorneys let the ADA abuse her authority.\\nIt was the only way I knew 
to force my attorneys to handle the situation.\\nThe ADA said it was an honest mistake, and the judge said it didn\\u2019t prejudice my case since the court paid for a DNA expert.\\nA DNA expert who didn\\u2019t even get to testify due to the ADA pushing her time, ensuring he would 
already be gone.\\nIf she offered me that plea as an honest mistake, was the same misrepresentation of the evidence provided to the grand jury?\\nShe missed deadlines without concern and failed to follow through on document production, forcing additional delays.\\nI could not 
present a reasonable defense because evidence was lost during these forced delays.\\nThis was never brought up during my trial.\\nThe prosecution was allowed to present the evidence as if I was trying to hide it.\\nThe attorney to whom I reported the item no longer represented me, 
so he could not handle this miscommunication in person or give a statement that no search warrant was required since he was to address it with the DA.\\nEven though he was with the same firm then, this wasn\\u2019t represented to the court during my trial.\\nThe vast discrepancies 
between the conversations of the witnesses and the detective and the same witnesses and the private investigator were never brought up to the court.\\nSignificant differences made it apparent that the statements made to the police and the private investigator were false.\\nThe 
discrepancies in the accuser's statements on the stand were not addressed.\\nOnce she testified, it should have been relatively easy to point out how ridiculous this route was if one was running for their life.\\nThis could be combined with how she claimed the event occurred.\\nI 
asked my attorneys when we could press perjury charges since the statements about the event were not physiologically possible.\\nThey also never asked about the hour gap in the timeline that was in the witness testimony.\\nThe fact that the other gentlemen with Lauren Deal that 
night were not interviewed also leads one to suspect the investigation.\\nThere was no concern to detail the night's events to ascertain a solid timeline.\\nThe detective in charge of the investigation had many hours of investigative training.\\nHe didn\\u2019t attempt to utilize 
any of that training to establish an investigation.\\nHe also didn\\u2019t report that on the night he arrested me (after a four-hour investigation) he said he would work with the magistrate to get my bail lowered so I could go home.\\nI believe it was because he knew I didn\\u2019t 
do it but was told to carry out the arrest, which brings me to Brady violations.\\nIt was said that more conversations occurred about this case with the detective.\\nThey were not turned over in discovery.\\nOne of the state's witnesses even testified in court to intimidation by the 
detective and the ADA\\nwhile he was there to testify and over the phone during an interview.\\nThis unjust prosecution was marked by many changes of the presiding judge, not allowing the Honorable Winston Gilchrist to have visibility of the repeated abuse of position by the 
ADA.\\nThis didn\\u2019t allow my attorneys ample time for review to add to my defense.\\nThe DNA specialist didn't get to testify due to a surgery he had scheduled.\\nAs he departed, he told my mother that he had told the ADA in plenty of time, and she had told him he would be able 
to testify Thursday.\\nThe ADA presented 95 pieces of evidence to the jury, the defense didn\\u2019t present a single piece of evidence, and yet the vote was 12-0 on the\\ncharge of 1st-degree rape.\\nWhen we returned to court on 31 October 2023, my attorney asked the ADA why she 
was pursuing another trial.\\nMy attorney tried to tell her the actual count but eventually gave up as he said it was useless because she wouldn't listen.\\nThis is just another example of how the truth doesn\\u2019t matter to anyone involved in this case.\\nThe person who tried to 
bribe me is friends with all the parties involved, including\\nthe accuser's family and the police force.\\nI was proven innocent in the first case.\\nA 12-0 and 9-3 verdict in my favor without us even presenting evidence.\\nBARD - I was not convicted.\\nIt is my belief That This 
young attorney Was acting Within the scope that was assigned to him By the founder of The Firm.\\nThis limitation Didn't allow him to understand.\\nThe other issue Was the States Witnesses Showing up to the case Their inability To have a deposition For Miss Tiffany Allen Severely 
damage the case It is.\\nThe fact that they didn't Give a deposition Or deposition time for Miss Allen.\\nAlso, limited to testimony Of Roger Hoskins.\\nAnd yet there's also one more which is probably the most important reason in which all these Witnesses being present, Would have 
been essential, Is to show the Corruption And bias.\\nThe statement alone from the first officer that interviewed Lauren deal The statement that set his job was to ensure That my defendant was found guilty.\\nThey limited amount of documentation that this officer maintained Was 
abysmal, The lack of any sort of timeline.\\nUh, any lack of corroboration between Witnesses and their statements Later interviews to verify previous statements.\\nIf he had taken The betting For more this had occurred, He could prove or disprove One of those involved 
statements.\\nIf he had taken them and any DNA From the accuser has shown up any hair sample, Anything had Has shown up that she had been in that bed.\\nIt would have directly contradicted.\\nThis is why we believe he didn't take them.\\nHe knew that the accuser Was making up this 
story.\\nAnd if he was a take Those materials as evidence, He himself Would be proving That she was lying.\\nThis was going acceptable since He had a family member involved in this investigation.\\nWe can tell that there was a blatant attempt And ensuring one outcome And that 
outcome Was not Innocence.\\nWas documented In the extreme Mystery Allen and Miss Allen's previous custody case.\\nIt is our belief That detective frame and should have taken the time to at least review some of the notes from that case or as permission.\\nAnd if she had given a 
partial bit of that documentation, he could have also asked for our mental assessments to be included Or any of the assessments, by the multitude Of psychological representatives.\\nEvery individual in the Allen case, Had a therapist And all of these therapists For managed By an 
expert That everyone with the court.\\nPut on Where the taxpayer again, Had to pay for the bad decisions Of those Willing To lie For their own gain.\\nMr. Allen's attorney unwillingness.\\nThis was apparently not the case.\\nMr. Allen found out During his trial Attorney.\\nOnce 
Pretty much stated That he had summarily ignored The extortion, attempt From the opposing party, If nothing else.\\nSo he may never practice law again Because he surely did not practice law In this case.\\nThere are still many unknowns While everyone else in this case.\\nWe don't 
understand why Jolanda made this statement that it didn't matter if Miss Rowland was guilty or not.\\nThis is a pretty important statement Because it aligns itself perfectly With what the officer said In the first interview With Missile.\\nCorroboration Of guilt Between those And 
the Lee County Sheriff's Department.\\nWe think it important the court to know, Mr. Allen's Previous interactions And how He knows that there is a Joe Linda but doesn't know Or did not know her last name.\\nHe simply stated that his children were not allowed To be in the 
vehicle.\\nJolanda Was driving, The statement wasn't made for any personal reason, But for the safety of his children, \\n\\nTo all those involved.\\nIn this case, Mr. Alam was only aware of her involvement.\\nIf I said I was innocent Her friends at the police department, Would make 
sure that that didn't matter.\\nBut combined with the other factors and the fact patterns that are established in this case, \\n\\nThe preponderance of evidence Leeds.\\nOne to believe That not only was a statement true But her friends ended up the police department Toad of the 
truth.\\nThey acted in every manner possible To ensure That there was no impartiality or fairness In this case.\\nThese weren't allowed For Mr. Allen He had made the wrong people, Angry Far before The accusation.\\nJustice isn't Wade By the scales of the blonde folded lady.\\nI also 
fundamentally believe That if the roles will reversed And he was the founding partner of the firm, The outcome of this case Would have been vastly different.\\n--- FILE: E:/Organization_Folder/02_Working_Folder/02_Analysis/06_Case

(Lauren), including her condition, interactions at hospitals, and subsequent actions like reporting to the police.\\nThis ties into broader themes of evidence collection, witness credibility, and the role of supporting individuals (e.g., Joseph's friend and Mr. DeMarco).\\nDeceased 
Witnesses and Disregarded Statements: Section 2 addresses Ms. Allen's death and the handling of her \\\"inflammatory statements,\\\" which were raised but ultimately dismissed in the trial.\\nEvidence Admissibility and Hearsay (Section 2): Ms. Allen's \\\"inflammatory statements\\\" 
were disregarded, which could involve risks related to hearsay rules (e.g., under Federal Rules of Evidence 801\\u2013803).\\nArguments might focus on the witness's reliability, as there's a noted \\\"no response recorded\\\" to one question, potentially indicating gaps in 
evidence.\\nAdditionally, references to third parties (e.g., Mr. DeMarco's behavior) could lead to arguments about motive, bias, or relevance, with risks of defamation claims if details are misrepresented.\\nIt avoids emotional language, inflammatory rhetoric, or bias, focusing 
instead on factual reporting and clarity.\\nProfessionalism: There are no signs of aggression, sarcasm, or defensiveness.\\nFactual discrepancies, like conflicting timelines from Tiffany, Roger, and Freeman, pose arguments about witness perjury or unreliable testimony, which could 
be used in cross-examinations to suppress evidence or question alibis.\\nThis approach avoids bias or emotional language, using objective phrasing (e.g., \\\"verify the timelines\\\") to present facts without advocating for any party.\\nI was in shock at the accusations.\\nI know 
she has accused numerous people over the years but I never thought she would accuse me.\\nTiffany said that I wasn\\u2019t \\u201cparticipating\\u201d in the investigation.\\nThe magistrate wouldn\\u2019t even look at the documents that I had.\\nI wanted a bench trial because I was 
concerned about Tiffany taking out another affidavit with more false information and getting me arrested again.\\nMy lawyer said that it would attach jeopardy to her claim so she couldn\\u2019t file it again.\\nThey still didn\\u2019t give me a bench trial.\\nMr. Whitaker informed 
them that if she did it again then we would file our own charges.\\nShe informed me that there had been new allegations coming from the children.\\nThere is also a required polygraph.\\nThey should have told me immediately about the accusations she was making.\\nThe allegations she 
made should have been relayed to me so that I could have restricted her access to the kids until she either recovered or managed contact under supervision, as was the court's direction during our custody case.\\nIf law enforcement had done the slightest amount of investigation, they 
would have discovered the compromising situation my children were placed in and should have notified me of her accusations so that previous court requirements could have been reinstated for the protection of my children.\\nFOR REFERENCE:\\nBackground - Family Reunification Report
