clearance has SCI access.\\nYou are only eligible for SCI screening if specific duties require access to this information.\\nThis required Single Scope Background Investigations, which are extensive background checks and investigation processes that can take several months or even 
years to complete.\\nA single-scope background investigation (SSBI) is the most comprehensive investigation that the government can conduct, in addition to interviews and reviews of financial, criminal, and medical records.\\nIt is designed to assess honesty and integrity by 
measuring various physiological responses while answering several questions.\\nI also held additional clearance levels reserved for individuals requiring access to sensitive or compartmented information.\\nThese include Special Access Programs (SAP) created for specific government 
projects or programs requiring additional screening.\\nThese Control System caveats included GAMMA, TALENT KEYHOLE, HUMINT, and SI.\\nSI / GAMMA - This sub-control system of SI is for highly sensitive communication intercepts (product or content) * and, therefore, requires the ORCON 
dissemination marking.\\nGAMMA may contain compartments identified by a codeword or an identifier of four alphabetic characters.\\nHUMINT/HCS -This control system is intended to provide enhanced protection to exceptionally fragile clandestine HUMINT sources, methods, and activities 
based on assessed value, critical nature, and information vulnerability.\\nTALENT KEYHOLE \\u2013 Covers space-based IMINT (imagery intelligence), SIGINT (signals intelligence), and MASINT (measurement and signature intelligence) collection platforms; related processing and analysis

for time working on the DNA.\\nI told them I didn\\u2019t have any additional resources to spend.\\nMy job was taken away once I was charged.\\nHow was their time being taken away from other avenues of my defense not a disadvantage for me?\\nThe ADA continually delayed turning over 
documents such as medical records.\\nA search warrant was served to retrieve an item from my property even after my attorney was informed that it was there, and I was told that the ADA would be contacted to retrieve it.\\nOther trash from the back of my vehicle was represented as 
something nefarious, even though they never bothered to retrieve the trash that had been saved for them from the residence or took the trash they tried to represent as evidence.\\nMy attorneys never addressed this, even though I repeatedly sent the property overview and asked where 
she ran to.\\nOne of the gentleman's father works with the police department.\\nThe other also works in some capacity for the city.\\nA request to retrieve all email communications and telephone calls from this time period would be appropriate.\\nThe second lesser included charge,

specific duties require access to this information.\\nThis required Single Scope Background Investigations, which are extensive background checks and investigation processes that can take several months or even years to complete.\\nA single-scope background investigation (SSBI) is 
the most comprehensive investigation that the government can conduct, in addition to interviews and reviews of financial, criminal, and medical records.\\nIt is designed to assess honesty and integrity by measuring various physiological responses while answering several 
questions.\\nI also held additional clearance levels reserved for individuals requiring access to sensitive or compartmented information.\\nThese include Special Access Programs (SAP) created for specific government projects or programs requiring additional screening.\\nThese 
Control System caveats included GAMMA, TALENT KEYHOLE, HUMINT, and SI.\\nSI / GAMMA - This sub-control system of SI is for highly sensitive communication intercepts (product or content) * and, therefore, requires the ORCON dissemination marking.\\nGAMMA may contain compartments 
identified by a codeword or an identifier of four alphabetic characters.\\nHUMINT/HCS -This control system is intended to provide enhanced protection to exceptionally fragile clandestine HUMINT sources, methods, and activities based on assessed value, critical nature, and 
information vulnerability.\\nTALENT KEYHOLE \\u2013 Covers space-based IMINT (imagery intelligence), SIGINT (signals intelligence), and MASINT (measurement and signature intelligence) collection platforms; related processing and analysis techniques; and research, design, and

been tried if it hadn\\u2019t been for statements made by Tiffany Allen.\\nWe have a long history in the Family Courts in Lee County.\\nI turned the phone over to my attorney.\\nIt was misplaced during the transition between lawyers in the firm after the State asked for 37 
continuances.\\nI am unable to work due to the requirements placed on me by the government, so the ADA used this to drain my resources.\\nI am a single father struggling to support two children with no income.\\nI still had the examples I sent to my first attorney, but that is 
all.\\nI will include snapshots that I sent to my first attorney.\\nI would pass over the phone and data, but this was misplaced by my attorneys at some point over the past few years.\\nBrendan Allen \\u2013 (484)929-6524\\nCarter Olson \\u2013 (507)822-8214\\nMorgan and Lukas still 
live with me, but I could have made them available if they had even thought to ask.\\nFormer Family Law Paralegal at Wilson, Reives, Silverman & Doran, PLLC.\\nWorked for the local government since 2013.\\nHe is a building inspector for the local government.\\nHis father works with 
the police department.\\nThe request was entered on Dec 9th, 2019.\\nThe ADA, my attorneys, and the judge had to track them down the day of court.\\nI told my attorney that this was impossible.\\nThe ADA, my attorneys, and the judge sat down to discuss.\\nThe ADA was informed that 
the expert had a set time to leave because he had surgery scheduled.\\nThe ADA said that there would be plenty of time before then.\\nEven with the expert being provided, I was still disadvantaged.\\nI asked my attorneys if they had billed me for time working on the DNA.\\nI told 
them I didn\\u2019t have any additional resources to spend.\\nMy job was taken away once I was charged.\\nHow was their time being taken away from other avenues of my defense not a disadvantage for me?\\nThe ADA continually delayed turning over documents such as medical records.\\nA 
search warrant was served to retrieve an item from my property even after my attorney was informed that it was there, and I was told that the ADA would be contacted to retrieve it.\\nOther trash from the back of my vehicle was represented as something nefarious, even though they 
never bothered to retrieve the trash that had been saved for them from the residence or took the trash they tried to represent as evidence.\\nMy attorneys never addressed this, even though I repeatedly sent the property overview and asked where she ran to.\\nOne of the gentleman's 
father works with the police department.\\nThe other also works in some capacity for the city.\\nA request to retrieve all email communications and telephone calls from this time period would be appropriate.\\nThe second lesser included charge, the vote was 9-3, both in favor of 
acquittal.\\nFiled on: 10/19/2019\\nElectronic Warrants Warrant ID: 70d96ae76b21f862ca9f86f9e1335 \\nCriminal Process Number: 19MO1281492\\nElectronic Warrants Warrant ID: b34b46ea36dcb6f18829bcea5bde\\nCriminal Process Number: 19RO1281715\\nACIS File Number Key:

Goodfellas and Schooley\\u2019s.\\nFormer Family Law Paralegal at Wilson, Reives, Silverman & Doran, PLLC.\\nWorked for the local government since 2013 and worked with the detective's brother.\\nHe is a building inspector for the local government.\\nHis father works with the police 
department.\\nHis father took custody of me the morning I made bail.\\nFrank Collins \\u2013 First Attorney\\nJason Wunsch \\u2013 Second Attorney / Knew the detective, so didn\\u2019t examine him on the stand\\nFreddie Cruz \\u2013 Second Attorney\\nDetective Steve Freeman \\u2013 
Network of friends with accusing party \\n\\nADA Tiffany Bartholomew:\\n-Lives in Pinehurst, North Carolina.\\nFrom Alexandria, Virginia\\n-Currently an ADA in Lee County, NC\\n-Previous ADA in Moore County, NC ~10 years\\n-During her tenure at Moore County, they had one the highest 
conviction rates for Sexual Assault in the state.\\n- Governor Roy Cooper appointed Tiffany Bartholomew, of Pinehurst, as District Court Judge serving Moore and Hoke Counties in 2019.\\nWhen I was asked to come back in by my attorney\\u2019s assistant, I told them that they could 
all go fuck themselves.\\nI can at least sit out here and smoke while y\\u2019all fuck me.\\u201d\\nThey went upstairs to discuss it with the judge and the ADA in chambers.\\nThe following is a summary of events that encapsulate this issue.\\nI believe this should be reviewed to 
determine how this conclusion was reached.\\nThe ADA used multiple underhanded techniques during that time.\\nThese include not turning over documents when agreed and not responding to inquiries promptly.\\nThe request was entered on Dec 9th, 2019.\\nThe ADA, my attorneys, and the 
judge had to track them down the day of court.\\nI told my attorney that this was impossible.\\nThe ADA, my attorneys, and the judge sat down to discuss.\\nThe ADA was informed that the expert had a set time to leave because he had surgery scheduled.\\nThe ADA said that there would 
be plenty of time before then.\\nEven with the expert being provided, I was still disadvantaged.\\nI asked my attorneys if they had billed me for time working on the DNA.\\nI told them I didn\\u2019t have any additional resources to spend.\\nMy job was taken away once I was 
charged.\\nHow was their time being taken away from other avenues of my defense not a disadvantage for me?\\nThe ADA continually delayed turning over documents such as medical records.\\nA search warrant was served to retrieve an item from my property even after my attorney was 
informed that it was there, and I was told that the ADA would be contacted to retrieve it.\\nOther trash from the back of my vehicle was represented as something nefarious, even though they never bothered to retrieve the trash that had been saved for them from the residence or took 
the trash they tried to represent as evidence.\\nMy attorneys never addressed this, even though I repeatedly sent the property overview and asked where she ran to.\\nOne of the gentleman's father works with the police department.\\nThe other also works in some capacity for the 
city.\\nA request to retrieve all email communications and telephone calls from this time period would be appropriate.\\nThe second lesser included charge, the vote was 9-3, both in favor of acquittal.\\n--- FILE: E:/Organization_Folder/02_Working_Folder/02_Analysis/06_Case

gotten deployed, which he's\\u2026 \\nOfficer Speaking: Whats his name?\\nThe lights come on at, like, 1:30, 1:45.\\nAnd which I don't know why.\\nThere is no video available that supports any of the above statements, even remotely.\\nFact Note: This is impossible.\\nAnd the 
information that you wrote is to the best of your knowledge true at that time?\\n-This is important in other ways.\\nADA Bartholomew: And what information did you get during that brief from Deputy Haines?\\nMy car is a Good Fellows because that's where we were to start with.\\nThis 
is a series of fabrications on display.\\nDo we have all the jurors?\\nJust wanted to clear that up.\\nLAUREN DEAL DIRECT EXAM cont'd BY MS. BARTHOLOMEW\\nQ: And what is that?\\nIs that on your righthand side of your body?\\nQ: Lauren, I'm handing you\\nA: collection of photographs

yes.\\nCourt transcript:\\nMS. BARTHOLOMEW: Now, you had been in this house several times  before.\\nThere is a set of stairs that go down.\\nAnd what social media platform was that?\\nMS. BARTHOLOMEW: Lauren, I'm handing you what's been marked for identification purposes as a 
document labeled State's\\nExhibit number four.\\nDo you recognize State's Exhibit number four?\\nAnd what do you recognize State's Exhibit number four to be?\\nMS. BARTHOLOMEW: And do you know how the state came in possession of State's Exhibit number four?\\nAnd do you still have 
the messages on your actual cell phone?\\nAnd in State's Exhibit number four, exact copy of the message, looks like it's from 2016 between you and the defendant?\\nMS. BARTHOLOMEW:  Your honor, at this time, the state would introduce State's Exhibit number four.\\nWe're picking out 
one page.\\nActually, let me see the attorneys first.\\nMR. WUNSCH:  There is a --\\nTHE COURT:  Just approach, please.\\nLadies and gentlemen, I'll ask you just to go back in the jury room for just one moment while I sort this out.\\nThe court is reviewing what appears to be, I 
guess this is the seven -- are there seven total?\\nThere are six in these sheets.\\nWhat appears to be seven screenshots of purported messages.\\nAnything further that the defense wants to say?\\nMR. WUNSCH:  Also lacks foundation, your honor.\\nSo there is -- it's clearly not -- 
you know, we have somebody else identifying themselves.\\nCourt has reviewed State's Exhibit number four.\\nSo now, if you want some of these other pages that even the state concedes appear to be another individual, under the rule of completeness, I'll allow you to do that, but 
state isn't trying to introduce statements that were purportedly made by Ben -- I mean, by Matt using Ben's phone.\\nThey are simply trying to introduce the very first one.\\nAnd again, they will need to link this up with a conversation prior to December 3, 2016.\\nI'll pass these 
back to the state.\\nMR. WUNSCH:  Your honor, we would just note our objection for the record.\\n[The jury entered the courtroom and were seated in jury box] \\nTHE COURT:  All right.\\nLadies and gentlemen, in my discretion, I have overruled the objection, found the proposed 
exhibit number four to be admissible and sufficiently reliable to be admitted.\\nMS. BARTHOLOMEW: So Lauren, if you could just -- is there a date that these messages are set on State's Exhibit number four?\\nMS. BARTHOLOMEW: And at what time does the first message come in?\\nMS. 
BARTHOLOMEW: And what does it say?\\nSorry for the short notice.\\nSo what time -- is there a timestamp for when your reply was made?\\n(The court also flagged Rule 106 completeness for later pages showing \\u201canother individual using his phone.\\u201d)\\nApplication.\\nA general 
question about prior bonfires (\\u201cHow many times\\u2026?\\u201d \\u201cMaybe five.\\u201d).\\nThe \\u201cmaybe five bonfires\\u201d answer proves prior practice, not the required prior conversation specific to the 1:49 text.\\nThat link wasn\\u2019t supplied.\\nAnd whose vehicle 
did you drive?\\n4) This is all a ploy to violate my rights, which they have proven they are willing to do just because they can.\\nI have been wondering about something.\\nI was not brought before a magistrate, but the paperwork says I saw Judge Jones on the 21st.\\nI was arrested 
on the 19th, and released on the 20th.\\nAs a matter of fact, on the exhibit log it says there is no chain of custody.\\nA detailed timeline is in the attachment.\\nWhere are the phone logs from the cell I was kept in?\\nThey provide important context for later.\\nThe rights of 
citizens sure doesn\\u2019t matter to this group.\\nWhole lotta nonsense here that can\\u2019t get sorted just in Lee County.\\nA deal or informal arrangement was made to delay or avoid formal documentation.\\nThese records are public documents and should be available to ensure 
transparency in law enforcement\\u2019s response and hospital reporting practices.\\nAdditional subpoenas need to be issued along with a discovery motion to access all 911 records, incident reports, and hospital documentation related to Deal\\u2019s visit to CCH that night.\\nThese 
documents are essential to understanding the initial law enforcement response and any deviations from the protocol.\\nThis constitutional guarantee is further implemented through statutory provisions.\\nThe North Carolina Court of Appeals affirmed this right's centrality
