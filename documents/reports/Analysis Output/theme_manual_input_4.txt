\"Remember he said that it was messy and no room?\", \"I would rather he admit on record that he went there that night.\", \"The Serious Problems With Laruen Deal's Story of How She Was Raped.\", \"A. Lauren would have continually screamed (but neither the two gentleman sitting 
outside Ben's bedroom, nor the 12 year old sleeping downstairs, heard a thing from the house) B. Lauren would have tremendously fought back (but there is absolutely no evidence of any marks on the defendant) C. Lauren would have had bruising on specific places on her body (but there 
is no bruising in her thigh area, no bruising on her wrists or any marks on her head or face, where you would expect, given how she stated this rape occured) D. Lauren states that she was turned around and pushed onto the bed, laying on her back on the bed after she pulled up her 
pants from urinating, she also said that Ben stood in the doorway and watched her urinate (why would Ben have waited for Lauren to pull back up her pants, to then have to remove her pants to rape her) E. Lauren states that Ben held her hands behind her head, while pulling her pants 
down, taking her shoes off, taking his pants and underwear off and then raping her.\", \"( How did Ben hold both hands above her head with one hand, then manage to take off her skin tight leggings, remove her shoes, and then take his own clothes off, with only one hand, all while 
Lauren is fighting to get him off of her.\", \"Lauren's hands and feet are NOT tied and NO weapon is used.\", \"This would have been near impossible for Ben, who is short, for his arms to extend to where he could manipulate this leaning over her, and it is said that he was able to 
rape Lauren for up to 3 minutes.\", \"Lauren is also a very stout woman, near the same weight as Ben.\", \"I would also add, how did Ben get Lauren out of the bathroom, did he pull her out, spin her around, her arms and legs were free, we lack detail on this point) F. Lauren began 
screaming after she ran out half naked from the house (but not a peep was ever heard from her prior to her leaving the house) G. When Lauren ran out of the house, she accused the men sitting outside of Ben's window of being in on it.\", \"(why would she not tell them she had just 
been raped, she trusted them enough to ride home with them, and they were not in the house when it allegedly happened, was this paranoia from mixing large amounts of alcohol with depression medicaiton?\", \"She indicated to law enforcement that Joseph Demarco and Steve were nice to 
her at the bar and she trusted Demarco enough to hand over her keys to him, so  meone she had just met) H.Lauren Deal's cousin (Carmen Love), states that Lauren told her that all three men were in the house (this is the only time I have ever heard of all three men being in the 
house, and goes to Lauren's lack of an ability to tell the truth).\", \"There were photos taken of the house.\", \"(She was in the house during the alleged rape.)\", \"What was Lauren Deal's state of mind at the time of the rape given she ran out of Scully's screaming right before 
the alleged incident?\", \"(Lauren Deal was alleged to have run out of the bar screaming at Scully's the night of the incident and then had her head laying on the ground, Ben saw her run out of the bar, and saw her laying with her head on the pavement, Did Carmen Love see this?\",

(but neither the two gentleman sitting outside Ben's bedroom, nor the 12 year old sleeping downstairs, heard a thing from the house) B. Lauren would have tremendously fought back (but there is absolutely no evidence of any marks on the defendant) C. Lauren would have had bruising on 
specific places on her body (but there is no bruising in her thigh area, no bruising on her wrists or any marks on her head or face, where you would expect, given how she stated this rape occured) D. Lauren states that she was turned around and pushed onto the bed, laying on her 
back on the bed after she pulled up her pants from urinating, she also said that Ben stood in the doorway and watched her urinate (why would Ben have waited for Lauren to pull back up her pants, to then have to remove her pants to rape her) E. Lauren states that Ben held her hands 
behind her head, while pulling her pants down, taking her shoes off, taking his pants and underwear off and then raping her.\\n( How did Ben hold both hands above her head with one hand, then manage to take off her skin tight leggings, remove her shoes, and then take his own clothes 
off, with only one hand, all while Lauren is fighting to get him off of her.\\nLauren's hands and feet are NOT tied and NO weapon is used.\\nThis would have been near impossible for Ben, who is short, for his arms to extend to where he could manipulate this leaning over her, and it 
is said that he was able to rape Lauren for up to 3 minutes.\\nLauren is also a very stout woman, near the same weight as Ben.\\nI would also add, how did Ben get Lauren out of the bathroom, did he pull her out, spin her around, her arms and legs were free, we lack detail on this 
point) F. Lauren began screaming after she ran out half naked from the house (but not a peep was ever heard from her prior to her leaving the house) G. When Lauren ran out of the house, she accused the men sitting outside of Ben's window of being in on it.\\n(why would she not tell 
them she had just been raped, she trusted them enough to ride home with them, and they were not in the house when it allegedly happened, was this paranoia from mixing large amounts of alcohol with depression medicaiton?\\nShe indicated to law enforcement that Joseph Demarco and 
Steve were nice to her at the bar and she trusted Demarco enough to hand over her keys to him, so  meone she had just met) H.Lauren Deal's cousin (Carmen Love), states that Lauren told her that all three men were in the house (this is the only time I have ever heard of all three men 
being in the house, and goes to Lauren's lack of an ability to tell the truth).\\nThere were photos taken of the house.\\n(She was in the house during the alleged rape.)\\nWhat was Lauren Deal's state of mind at the time of the rape given she ran out of Scully's screaming right 
before the alleged incident?\\n(Lauren Deal was alleged to have run out of the bar screaming at Scully's the night of the incident and then had her head laying on the ground, Ben saw her run out of the bar, and saw her laying with her head on the pavement, Did Carmen Love see 
this?\\nDid the two gentlemen sitting outside of his window at Ben's house see this?\\nOfficer Haynes Interview \\\"I mean, I did everything I could to get away from him, but he is a lot stronger than me and a lot bigger thanme.\\n(Stated to Officer Haynes) \\\" \\\"You 
freeze.\\nYou\\u2019re so shocked or you just freeze.\\nMentally you, it\\u2019s like your brain cannot comprehendwhat is going on and it\\u2019s like worse than fight or flight mode.\\nLauren never mentioned freezing to either officer or any hospitalpersonnel in the 
interviews.\\n\\\"He took my pants off along with my shoes.\\\"\\n(at trial she says that her shoes could have fallen off, on crossexamination she said Ben took them off) \\\"I know when he loosened his grip, I got up and ran.\\\"\\n\\\"He let loose for a minute, I have no idea, I 
guess he thought I wouldn't run.\\\"\\n(but he was still on top of you?)\\n\\\"I have bruises on my arms from being held down.\\\"\\n(at trial she stated that the one bruise on the front ofher arm might be from when she was pushed backwards onto the bed, OR might be from falling in 
thewoods, all other bruising attributed to the woods.\\nHow would she get a bruise on the front of her armfrom falling backwards?\\nFreddie also mentioned a place in the bar video where she missed the barchair while she was sitting down where this bruise may have come from) \\\"He's

earlier) \\\"I don't know how long it lasted, sex.\\\"\\nnot in any of the interviews 1 /4 \\\"He released his grip a little bit, not enough to actually let me go but enough that he released his grip andwhen he did I started kicking my feet and I got up and I ran out of his

Problems\\nWith\\nLaruen Deal's Story of How She Was Raped.\\nA. Lauren would have continually\\nscreamed\\n(but neither the two gentleman sitting outside Ben's bedroom, nor the 12 year\\nold\\nsleeping downstairs, heard a thing from the house) B. Lauren would 
have\\ntremendously\\nfought back (but there is absolutely no evidence of any marks on the defendant)\\nC.\\nLauren would have had bruising on specific places on her body (but there is no\\nbruising\\nin her thigh area, no bruising on her wrists or any marks on her head or 
face,\\nwhere\\nyou would expect, given how she stated this rape occured) D. Lauren states that\\nshe\\nwas turned around and pushed onto the bed, laying on her back on the bed after\\nshe\\npulled up her pants from urinating, she also said that Ben stood in the 
doorway\\nand\\nwatched her urinate (why would Ben have waited for Lauren to pull back up her\\npants,\\nto then have to remove her pants to rape her) E. Lauren states that Ben held\\nher\\nhands behind her head, while pulling her pants down, taking her shoes off,\\ntaking\\nhis 
pants and underwear off and then raping her.\\n( How did Ben hold both hands\\nabove\\nher head with one hand, then manage to take off her skin tight leggings, remove\\nher\\nshoes, and then take his own clothes off, with only one hand, all while Lauren\\nis\\nfighting to get him 
off of her.\\nLauren's hands and feet are NOT tied and NO\\nweapon\\nis used.\\nThis would have been near impossible for Ben, who is short, for his\\narms\\nto extend to where he could manipulate this leaning over her, and it is said\\nthat\\nhe was able to rape Lauren for up to 3 
minutes.\\nLauren is also a very stout\\nwoman,\\nnear the same weight as Ben.\\nI would also add, how did Ben get Lauren out of\\nthe\\nbathroom, did he pull her out, spin her around, her arms and legs were free, we\\nlack\\ndetail on this point) F. Lauren began screaming after she 
ran out half naked\\nfrom\\nthe house (but not a peep was ever heard from her prior to her leaving the\\nhouse)\\nG. When Lauren ran out of the house, she accused the men sitting outside of\\nBen's\\nwindow of being in on it.\\n(why would she not tell them she had just been 
raped,\\nshe\\ntrusted them enough to ride home with them, and they were not in the house when\\nit\\nallegedly happened, was this paranoia from mixing large amounts of alcohol with\\ndepression\\nmedicaiton?\\nShe indicated to law enforcement that Joseph Demarco and Steve 
were\\nnice\\nto her at the bar and she trusted Demarco enough to hand over her keys to him,\\nso\\nmeone she had just met) H.Lauren Deal's cousin (Carmen Love), states that\\nLauren\\ntold her that all three men were in the house (this is the only time I have\\never\\nheard of all 
three men being in the house, and goes to Lauren's lack of an\\nability\\nto tell the truth).\\nThere were photos taken of the house.\\n(She was in the house during the\\nalleged\\nrape.)\\nWhat was Lauren Deal's state of mind at the time of the rape given she\\nran\\nout of 
Scully's screaming right before the alleged incident?\\n(Lauren Deal was\\nalleged\\nto have run out of the bar screaming at Scully's the night of the incident and\\nthen\\nhad her head laying on the ground, Ben saw her run out of the bar, and saw her\\nlaying\\nwith her head on the 
pavement, Did Carmen Love see this?\\nDid the two gentlemen\\nsitting\\noutside of his window at Ben's house see this?\\nOfficer Haynes Interview \\\"I mean, I did everything I could to get away\\nfrom\\nhim, but he is a lot stronger than me and a lot bigger thanme.\\n(Stated

left.\\nThis inconsistency suggests that Carmen's narrative may be influenced by her relationship with the detective and her desire to align with familial expectations.\\nTiffany Allen's Influence: Tiffany Allen, Ben's estranged wife, had a history of mental illness and had made 
unsubstantiated accusations against him, including false claims of child abuse.\\nThe documentation indicates that Tiffany had been diagnosed with severe mental health issues, which were recognized by multiple professionals.\\nBehavioral Observations: Witnesses described Lauren as 
being overly intoxicated at the bar, with Steve Happel stating that she was acting hysterical and calling them \\\"assholes.\\\"\\nThis behavior contrasts sharply with her portrayal of herself as a victim who was coherent and aware of her surroundings during the alleged 
assault.\\nThe discrepancy in her behavior before and after the incident suggests that her recollection may be influenced by her state of intoxication and emotional distress.\\nThe lack of follow-up with Carmen, who was present at the bar and had a close relationship with Lauren, 
deprived the investigation of critical context and corroboration for Ben's defense.\\nThis attempt to coerce Ben into paying off Lauren raises serious questions about the motivations behind the allegations.\\nFor instance, Carmen claims to have seen Lauren talking to unfamiliar men 
just as she was leaving the bar, while Joseph and Steve state they met Lauren for the first time after Carmen had left.\\nAdditionally, Lauren's arrival at Ben's house is placed at around 2:30 AM, but the timeline provided by other witnesses suggests a different sequence of 
events.\\nWe were separated, she was on heavy medication for Stage 4 lung cancer, and she was severely mentally ill. She brought up previous accusations about abuse of our children.\\nThe fact that this wasn\\u2019t done put my children at risk.\\nSince we were separated, I was 
unaware of her state of mind.\\nI had let her borrow my phone.\\nIt was returned when she passed away.\\nIt was $5,000 out of my pocket and possibly the smoking gun on me being set up.\\nHer tactic of delay has the intended impact.\\nTiffany's Text Messages from Missing Phone (See

police department assured her that I was going down.\\nJoseph DeMarco - He was with me that night.\\nSteve Happel \\u2013 He was with me that night.\\nI also never received Lauren Deal\\u2019s medical records.\\nThe same with the trash from my bathroom that I had bagged to save for 
the detectives.\\nThe statements about where she ran were disturbing in the fact that they made no sense if she were escaping a dangerous situation.\\nShe took a path that made no sense for someone running for their life and was fearful of everyone there.\\nShe described an event 
that would be impossible to occur between two people.\\nIf I were to have done this, then I would be a danger to the public, so why would he do that?\\nHe had surgery scheduled for that Friday.\\nHe also said, \\\"Your son didn't do this, I will say a prayer for him and your 
family.\\\"\\nShe stated that both counts were 9-3.\\nCarmen Love's statements about events at Schooly's, which were later proven false by video evidence.\\nFor example, the report claims Carmen Love was worried and trying to contact Lauren all day, while the transcript shows Carmen 
admitted she forgot to text Lauren.\\nGiven the physical layout of the area, her account of running through woods for an extended period seems implausible and should have been more thoroughly investigated.\\nAllen describes Lauren as \\\"inebriated\\\" at Schooly's bar.\\nHe 
mentions Lauren throwing her keys to DeMarco and saying Allen was \\\"responsible for her now.\\\"\\nAllen states Lauren was upset, calling his friends \\\"assholes.\\\"\\nHe describes finding Lauren face down on concrete outside Schooly's.\\nAllen mentions his daughter was at home,

been touching them.\\nLukas denied seeing his father\\u2019s penis.\\nCommunication was difficult with Lucas as he does not speak clearly.\\nOn that day, it was noted that the mother was behaving erratically.\\nShe had taken children to a therapist and talked with Deb Flowers from 
UNC Beacon Team over the phone.\\nMother took recordings to a private detective.\\nSocial Worker Anderson listened to identified parts of the recording.\\nSounds heard could possibly be sexual abuse but could also have other explanations.\\nOn 1/30/2015, Lee County DSS received 
another report that indicated that Brendan Allen informed his step- mother that he has been being raped by his father since age 7.\\nBrendan described to Social Worker Anderson a history of sexual molestation by his father.\\nHe said he had not told anyone about this before, but is 
telling now because he knows that his dad and Tiffany are going to court on 2/4/2015 and he will probably live with his dad.\\nHe said that the abuse would then probably continue.\\nWhen social worker spoke with Lukas, and asked the child how he was doing, child spontaneously 
stated, \\u201cDaddy put his wiener in my mouth.\\nLukas described his dad\\u2019s \\u201cwiener\\u201d as big, black and soft.\\nHe said it happened one time.\\nWhen asked where he was when this happened, Lucas said he was in Carter\\u2019s bed and in Ben\\u2019s bed.\\nLukas then 
would not talk further with social worker about sexual abuse.\\nBrendan, Carter, and Lukas disclosed sexual abuse by father/step-father, Benjamin Allen.\\nSocial worker Anderson observed CME interviews.\\nAlso, Brendan\\u2019s mother, Sarah Allen, described numerous incidents where 
Tiffany Allen talked to the children about the case, discussed the case in front of the children, and talked to the children about what they should tell social workers and Dr. Matala.\\nMother indicated that kids all had parasite or bug bites.\\nWhen doctor asked the kids about 
their conditions, they said they had no itching or bug bites.\\nMom then told them to tell the truth that they were itching all over all the time, and the kids then agreed that mom was correct.\\nMom was scratching her own skin and it looked raw per the doctor.\\nMom brought in a 
Tupperware container with what appeared to be dust in it.\\nMom told the doctor to look at the bugs in the box, but there were none.\\nMother told doctor to look at the bugs crawling on the child, but there were no bugs on the child.\\nDoctor noted that it appeared that mother had 
mental health issue, not substance abuse issue.\\nOutcome: Services not needed - Children released to family members\\n\\n2/7/14\\u2014Allegations: Tiffany Allen smoking a pipe/bong outside of home and Benjamin Allen sometimes comes outside and watches her.\\nMarijuana smell comes

at Ben Allen\\u2019s house with other friends.\\u201d\\n \\\"They were at Schooly's for several hours and at 2am Mrs. Deal stated she was asked by Ben and his friends if she wanted to go with them to Ben's house and have a bon fire, She agreed and told Carmen Love that she was 
leaving with Ben and his friends.\\\"\\nHaines Interview with Lauren Deal:\\nDeal Speaking: I was at the bar last night.\\nBen was at the bar last night.\\nI saw him, so I ran up and hugged him because I haven't seen him in maybe over a year.\\nAnd the only reason that I know him is 
because the old bartender that used to work at Schoolys, her ex-husband.\\nSo he was up there, and he had brought two of his guy friends with him, Jay and Steve and he introduced me to them.\\nYou know they were they were all really nice.\\nSo he asked me if I wanted to come back to 
his house to do a bonfire and he was going to invite some people over, so I was like, yeah of course that's fun.\\nFreeman Interview with Lauren Deal:\\nLauren Deal: \\\"So we all sat down started drinking.\\ntalking just hanging out, so Carmen and James and Peter all go to leave, 
and they are like, come on Lauren, let's go.\\nAnd Ben looked at me, and he was like, well, I think we're going to have a bonfire at my house tonight if you want to come.\\nSo I was like, okay, I'll do that.\\nAnd then I'll go to Carmen's, so, I told I told, Carmen that would be 
there later but ended up going with Ben and his friends to his house.\\nTestimony by Lauren Deal:\\nBarthlomew: \\\"And then how long would you say you were at Schooly's?\\\"\\nLauren Deal: \\\"Till closing, so right at 2:00.\\nBarthlomew: And what was the -well, who was still at 
Schooly's when the lights came on?\\\"\\nLauren Deal: \\\"I mean, quite a few people, but mainly me, Ben, Jay and Steve, and then just other patrons.\\\"\\nSo what happened to Carmen, James and Peter?\\\"\\nLauren Deal: \\\"They left, because as the night had progressed, I had hung 
out with Ben and Jay and Steve quite a bit throughout the night, and Ben had mentioned that he was going to have a bonfire over at his house, and that I was, you know, more than welcome to come and hang out with them, so I decided to do that because I did not want my night to end, 
and so I told Carmen that I was going to go over there, and that's what happened, so she left with Peter and James.\\\"\\nFreeman Recorded Phone Interview With Joseph DeMarco:\\n\\u201cWhen we were at Schoolys, Ben started talking to Lauren.\\nEveryone is drinking, having a fun 
time, and then after the bar was shut down, we went back to Bens to sit by a fire.\\\"\\nFreeman Recorded Phone Interview With Steve Happel:\\nSteve Happel: Yeah, we just showed up at Schoolys.\\nIt's kind of like, well, there was really no atmosphere.\\nAnd then that girl kind of 
came out of no where and started being around us and acting kind of hysterical you know we didn't give her any attention then she'd call us bunch of assholes multiple times.\\nI didn't give her a single reason.\\nLike I just did not pay attention to her and then I think she gave 
someone her keys cuz she was too drunk cuz she was drinking at another bar before Schoolys.\\nThen she had nowhere to go.\\nSo then she came back to Ben Allen's house.\\nThere is no mention of Carmen Love, James Morrison, or Peter West in these interviews.\\nThese names are entirely 
unknown to Happel and DeMarco since they never met, regardless of what other statements may say.\\nFreeman Recorded Phone Call with Carmen Love:\\nCarmen Love: No, I mean, like she hung out with me, James, and you know Pete.\\nWe were   all standing at the table, and she would sit 
there and talk to us; um, there was a, one of,   another friend there named Joseph.\\nI do know that she was, I mean, she talked to him.\\nDetective Freeman: OK. \\nCarmen Love: but he was a mutual friend.\\nUm, I forgot about that, but he's a mutual friend.\\nThere was a bunch of 
people around, you know, in there.\\n(She says later there weren\\u2019t many   people.)\\nDetective Freeman: OK. \\nCarmen Love: So that I knew, but I do know that Joseph and her had a conversation, her and James did, uh, her and Pete spoke briefly, but you know.\\nDetective 
Freeman: OK. \\nCarmen Love: Then I seen those two guys talking to her that I've never seen before, but that  was right when we were going to leave, and she said she wanted to stay, that she was fine, she hadn't, you know, she can drive or whatever.\\n(Her car wasn\\u2019t even 
there.)\\nCarmen Love: and I said, all right, let me know if you need a ride, just call me James even told her he would ride back up there with me to get her and so, but I mean, do remember like Joseph being in there, me, James, Pete, uh and honestly, I probably can't tell you any 
names of anyone else because there wasn't a lot of people there anyways, but there wasn't  a lot of people I knew.\\nCarmen's story is more aligned later on, but that is much later.\\nFact Note: In addition, Carmen also doesn\\u2019t mention everyone sitting together and 
drinking.\\nShe mentions the name Joseph (DeMarco) as a friend.\\nShe had no way of knowing this name, as Carmen had left the bar before Lauren had met him.\\nSomeone told her that name.\\nEvidence From Video Recording:\\nFact Note: Video evidence shows that Carmen Love had already 
left the bar at 12:41 AM, making it impossible for the accuser to have spoken to her at 2:00 AM\\u200b.\\nThroughout the entire video while Love is present, there is not a single instance where these two groups meet or interact, rendering this a fabrication.\\nNo one other than Deal 
said that she was invited to Ben\\u2019s house.\\nDeal forced her way into the group and inherently into the vehicle to get to the defendants home.\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nFreeman Affidavit: 
\\n\\u201cUpon arrival they started a fire and after several minutes Mrs. Deal stated she needed to use the restroom and went inside.\\nShe stated that she was familiar with the residence because she had been there before with his ex-wife.\\nWhen she went inside she stated that Ben 
walked inside with her and followed her to the bathroom.\\u201d\\n\\u201cUpon arrival at the house, they were sitting around the fire, The victim stated that they requested to use the restroom and was followed in the residence of 94 Beacon Circle by the owner Ben 
Allen.\\u201d\\nOfficer Haines Interview:\\nLauren Deal, \\u201cI told Ben I need to use the bathroom.\\nSo he takes me inside.\\u201d\\nHaines Police Interview:\\nLauren Deal, \\u201cJoseph and Steve started getting firewood to put onto the fire, and I looked at Ben and I told him 
that I had to pee, so he walked me inside.\\u201d\\nFreeman Police Interview:\\nDeal Speaking: \\\"It was it was no later than 245, so I walked inside, and I've been in this house before because I've been in there with Tiffany.\\nSo I knew where everything was, and he told me to use 
the restroom in his room.\\nSo like, when you walk into his room, it's his room, and then his bathroom is back there.\\nSo I walked back there, and he followed me into the bathroom and stood in the doorway, and I was like, you know, I said get out.\\nI have to pee, he's like, no, 
I'm gonna stand here.\\u201d\\n\\nFreeman Phone Interview with Joseph DeMarco:\\nDeMarco, \\u201dWe were collecting firewood getting a fire going again.\\nLauren and Ben then went inside.\\u201d\\nHappel, \\u201cSo then she came back to Ben Allen's house.\\nI woke up, I was just 
about to call the police, and then I get afraid and leave.\\nThen, when I leave, I'm driving down the road near Route 1, and I see her running through a field.\\\"\\nFact Note: DeMarco never said he searched for her.\\n\\u201cThey were at Schooly's for several hours and at 2am Mrs. 
Deal stated she was asked by Ben and his friends if she wanted to go with them to Ben's house to have a bonfire.\\nShe agreed and told Carmen Love that she was leaving with Ben and his friends.\\\"\\nCarmen Love can be seen exiting the bar with James Morrison at 12:41:25.\\nThis 
occurred before Lauren Deal had approached or spoken to anyone in the group.\\nDeal Speaking: \\u201cI told him to get out because I had to pee and he stood in the doorway and he told me that he was going to watch me.\\nSo I still pulled my pants down because I had to pee and I was 
like just please get out.\\nI have to pee\\u201d\\nFreeman affidavit: \\\"In the bedroom he held her down on the bed with her arms above her head and then pulled her pants down.\\\"\\nI woke up I was I was just about to call the police and then you know I get I get afraid and I 
leave and then when I leave, I'm driving down the road near Route 1 and I see her running through a field.\\\"\\nLauren says that he found her and she hid behind a tree and DeMarco says field.\\nThen there is the fact that the direction DeMarco would have driven would have taken him 
the opposite direction of Sanford making it very unlikely he would have encountered Lauren if she had actually ran.\\nShe didn't run ten miles or two or even a tenth of a mile.\\nShe even made up commentary she \\\"heard\\\" when they were looking for her. \\\"\\nFreeman affidavit: 
\\\"Mr. Happle stated that his friends Joseph Demarco and Ben Allen went to Schooly's and while they were there they met up with Lauren.\\\"\\nIt's kind of like well there was really no atmosphere.\\nAnd then that girl kind of came out of no where and started being around us and 
acting kind of hysterical you know we didn't give her any attention then she'd call us bunch of assholes multiple times.\\nAnd which I don't know I didn't give her a single reason.\\nLike I just did not pay attention to her and then I think she gave someone her keys cuz she was too 
drunk cuz she was drinking at another bar before Schoolys.\\nThen she had nowhere to go.\\nSo then she came back to Ben Allen's house.\\u201d \\nHe also testified to the same.\\nFreeman affidavit: \\\"After sometime Mrs. Love stated that they were going to leave and asked if Lauren 
needed a ride.\\nLauren declined and stated she was going to go hangout with the guys and go to a bon fire.\\nMrs. Love told her to call her later and that she could come pick her up.\\nMrs. Love stated that she became worried because she had been attempting to contact her all 
day.\\\"\\nCarmen Love's actual statement to Freeman ---Carmen Love: \\\"No.\\nYou know, earlier, I was laying there, we were laying in the bed watching TV, and I thought I need to text her to see if she's okay, and I checked my message messenger, and then Chloe called, and it just 
slipped my mind.\\\"\\nCarmen Love did not express any concern about Lauren.\\nFreeman affidavit: \\\"Upon getting to the house they started to build a fire and he walked inside the house behind Lauren while she went to the bathroom.\\nMr. Allen stated that he then went to his 
bedroom.\\nA short time later he heard noises and heard Lauren screaming in the woods and that he noticed Demarco and Steve talking to her.\\\"\\nReality from Recorded Interview:\\nDeMarco, \\\"We were collecting firewood, getting a fire going again.\\nLauren and Ben then went 
inside.\\\"\\nReality from Recorded Interview:\\nDeMarco, \\\" I was like..\\nI woke up I was I was just about to call the police and then you know I get I get afraid and I leave and then when I leave, I'm driving down the road near Route 1 and I see her running through a 
field.\\\"\\nLauren said DeMarco found her hiding behind a tree.\\nLauren also noted that it was pitch black outside and she couldn\\u2019t see her hand in front of her face, in an attempt to make the sequence of events more dramatic.\\nAll of these things can\\u2019t be 
true.\\nFreeman Interview:\\nLauren Deal: \\\"So we all sat down started drinking.\\ntalking just hanging out, so Carmen and James and Peter all go to leave, and they are like, come on Lauren, let's go.\\nAnd Ben looked at me, and he was like, well, I think we're going to have a 
bonfire at my house tonight if you want to come.\\nSo I was like, okay, I'll do that.\\nAnd then I'll go to Carmen's, so, I told I told, Carmen that would be there later ended up going with Ben and his friends to his house.\\nSteve Freeman: Yes, he told me that the victim in this 
case, Lauren Deal, she was actually at -- she was out with some friends.\\nThey were at Goodfellas, then proceeded to go over to Schooly's.\\nOnce they were at Schooly's, they went from Goodfellas to Schooly's.\\nShe was with her friends Carmen Love and her boyfriend James.\\nAnd 
once they got to Schooly's, they met up with the defendant, Benjamin Allen, and a couple of his friends, Joe DeMarco and Steve Happel.\\n(From Officer Haines Report: SHE WENT TO SCHOOLY'S BAR WITH HER COUSIN CARMEN LOVE, AND WHILE THERE, MET BEN ALLEN, AND HIS FRIENDS JOSEPH DEMARCO 
AND A SUBJECT WITH THE FIRST NAME OF STEVE.\\nSHE STATED THEY ALL DRANK TOGETHER, UNTIL 02:00 HRS, WITH CARMEN LOVE LEAVING THE BAR AT SOME POINT PRIOR DURING THE NIGHT, -------There is no mention of James Morrison or Peter West in the report from Officer Haines.)\\nLAUREN DEAL: So 
I was gonna stay with Carmen, which is my friend and cousin Carmen \\nFREEMAN: Carmen who?\\nFREEMAN: \\\"Alright So, we'll stay with Carmen Love.\\nLAUREN DEAL: \\\"Okay,\\\" \\nFREEMAN: \\\"Do you know her address?\\\"\\nLAUREN DEAL: \\\"No, she just moved in with her boyfriend 
today.\\nI don't know her address, and I would give you her phone number, but I don't have my phone back.\\nSo we said we were going to ride to Schoolys and go over there.\\nLAUREN DEAL: Me, her boyfriend, and her with Peter, her boyfriend, James Morrison and Peter West, and me, I 
got the four of us that went together.\\\"\\nJames, what you know his name?\\\"\\nLAUREN DEAL: \\\"No I don't and then Peter West and then me,\\\" Officer Speaking: \\\"Okay.\\nLAUREN DEAL: \\\"So I see him.\\nI give him a hug, I haven't seen him in maybe a year, so I gave him a 
hug.\\nWe talked as, and I was, he asked me how it was, you know, the normal conversation and then he said that he had brought two of his guy friends with him which was Joseph and Steve.\\\"\\nHaines Interview\\nDeal Speaking ----- I have bruises on my arms from being held 
down.\\nThey took pictures of them at the hospital.\\nQ: Did you inquire about any injuries that he may have that Mr. Allen would have sustained during this kicking match?\\nA: Well, I mean, there was as far as injuries go, physical injuries, I could see them on her feet.\\nShe had 
bruising on her arms.\\nQ: You seen the bruises through her longsleeved shirt?\\nA: No, I mean, she showed them to me.\\nQ: She pulled up her sleeves?\\nQ: I didn't see that in the video.\\nQ: So prior to the interview?\\nA: Yeah, as we were going back.\\nEarlier you stated that you 
noticed the bruises on Ms. Deal's arms, correct?\\nQ: And you noticed them because she showed you while you all were walking back to the interview, correct?\\nA: Well, as we were walking back to where she the front lobby.\\nQ: So this happened after the interview?\\nSo you never 
inquired about it during the time of the interview?\\nQ: Now, Ms. Deal told you that she had bruises on her arms from being held down, correct?\\nA: That's what she stated.\\nQ: And you were not here when she said that that bruise may have come from falling in the woods, 
correct?\\nQ: But she maintained to you that she had bruises from being held down, correct?\\nQ: And that would have been around the wrist, correct?\\nA: That's what she implied.\\nA: Right here, like my neck, clavicle area.\\nAnd did you have any injury to that area?\\nA: Some 
cuts, some looks like bruises forming already.\\nAnd do you know how you got those cuts and bruises?\\nA: Yeah, in the woods, falling, being pushed.\\nMS. BARTHOLOMEW: Your honor, if I may approach the witness?\\nQ: You are just going to have to keep your voice up just\\nA: little 
bit.\\nQ: And did you have any do you know if that's your left arm or your right arm?\\nDid you have any injury to your left arm?\\nA: I had bruises and scratches.\\nAnd what were those bruises and scratches from?\\nQ Meaning forward in flirtation, is that how you took it?\\nQ As a 
matter of fact, she said that that's kind of how he acted that night, too, correct?\\nA I was not in here for that.\\nQ As a matter of fact, you were not here for the that's why she went home with him.\\nQ Now, Ms. Deal told you that she had bruises on her arms from being held down, 
correct?\\nQ And you were not here when she said that, that bruise may have come from falling in the woods, correct?\\nQ But she maintained to you that she had bruises from being held down, correct?\\nQ And that would have been around the wrist, correct?\\nA That's what she 
implied.\\nLAUREN DEAL: We were really good friends.\\nI mean, I would go to her house.\\nMS. BARTHOLOMEW: You stated that you had been to Tiffany's house before.\\nLAUREN DEAL: They were off and on.\\nWere they living in the same residence?\\nAnd how many times would you just 
estimate that you had gone over to that house?\\nMS. BARTHOLOMEW: What would you do when you would go there?\\nLAUREN DEAL: We grilled out.\\nWe would sit around and talk, just hang out.\\nMS. BARTHOLOMEW: And you said that you both had met each other's kids.\\nHow many kids did 
Tiffany have?\\nLAUREN DEAL: The only two that I met were the two -- I mean, I don't want to say their name because I don't know if that's allowed or not.\\nMS. BARTHOLOMEW: If you know their names, you can say them.\\nLAUREN DEAL: Morgan and Lucas were the two that I 
met\\n\\nLauren claims to be really close to Tiffany.\\nThey both tried to play this up but the facts are she didn\\u2019t even know if Tiffany was married or not?\\nInterview with Officer Haines:\\nDeal Speaking: \\\" I'd known him previous to this because of his 
ex-wife.\\\"\\nDeal Speaking: \\\"I knew who he was; I'd hung out with him with his ex-wife before.\\nDo you know, have you known Ben before this?\\nDeal Speaking: \\\"His ex-wife used to work as the bartender at Schoolys?\\nWhich is how I knew him.\\u201d\\nInterview with Officer 
Haines:\\nOfficer Haines ----- Have you ever been to that house before?\\nDeal Speaking ----- I have been there before with Tiffany.\\nBefore they were separated, me and I went over there and cooked dinner for her and her kids.\\nShe has cancer and she lives with her mom in West 
Virginia now.\\nI haven't seen her in a while.\\nFact Note: She lived with two parents in Virginia.\\nThe word from Tiffanys sisters and Morgan is that they talked everyday after this happened and not before.\\nThat is why she got the state wrong.\\nThis is also why she got the 
number of kids wrong also.\\nTiffany lost custody of a child and she caused the defendant to lose custody of his child but their pictures are all over the walls in the house.\\nIf she only knew about two children then she must not really have been in the house.\\nWhen they were 
separated Tiffany lived in the house under the water tower by the courthouse.\\nThere was not pictures of the kids at that house.\\nLAUREN DEAL: You walk up the stairs into the front door.\\nThere is a living room that you walk into.\\nTheir bedroom door -- the living room is here, 
and the bedroom door is here.\\nThere is a bannister around the stairs.\\nThere is a bathroom behind the bannister of the stairs.\\nTo the right, there is a kitchen, and then beside of that is a dining room.\\nWhen you go downstairs, there is some bedrooms, and then at the very end 
of the hallway is a bathroom.\\nMS. BARTHOLOMEW: Now, had you ever spent the night at that residence?\\nLAUREN DEAL: Yes, in the downstairs bedroom.\\nMS. BARTHOLOMEW: Ever use the bathroom in that residence before?\\nLAUREN DEAL: Yes, in the downstairs and the guest bathroom 
upstairs.\\nFact Notes: It is like she saw pictures online and didn\\u2019t know what she was looking at.\\nShe doesn\\u2019t mention the largest room in the house.\\nAt the end of the hallway is a massive family room with another bathroom.\\nShe also missed a bedroom upstairs right 
by the bathroom.\\nHe had to be told because he wasn\\u2019t there when she was and after that she wasn\\u2019t allowed.\\nMS. BARTHOLOMEW: And did you ever communicate with the defendant through Facebook?\\nMS. BARTHOLOMEW:  Your honor, if I may approach the witness?\\nLAUREN DEAL: 
Messages between me and Ben.\\nAnd do you know who, or how did -- when you were contacting him or he was contacting you through Facebook, how would that work?\\nWould that be on the laptop, a cell phone or something else?\\nLAUREN DEAL: My cell phone.\\nAnd did you -- were you able 
to retrieve any messages that you had between yourself and Mr. Allen using Facebook?\\nLAUREN DEAL: Facebook Messenger, yes.\\nMS. BARTHOLOMEW: So Facebook Messenger, is that an application that allows you to send direct messages to the person?\\nLAUREN DEAL: I gave them to 
you.\\nMR. WUNSCH:  Well, in this message, it clearly states -- I mean, she is picking out part of it, but in this message, it clearly states that this is not Ben.\\nAnd the last message states later that Ben says, I wasn't even -- I didn't even have possession of my phone.\\nIt's 
clearly in the text it's not Ben.\\nJust know that we have a screenshot of a Facebook message.\\nMy real problem, though, your honor, is that we -- it's identified as another person conducting the message, and at the very end, Ben comes on, identified himself, saying, I didn't have 
my phone.\\nScreenshots from Facebook.\\nIt is a screenshot which this witness indicated came from her phone.\\nSays \\\"Ben Allen\\\" and has a date, December 3, 2016, 1:49 p.m.\\nIt references a discussion that they purportedly had about a bonfire.\\nIf she testifies that they had 
a discussion prior to December 3, 2016, at 1:49, then that would give this particular page context.\\nIt is true that the balance of the pages beginning on page two suggest that there is now another individual using his phone, but that occurs sometime later in the evening at 7:42 
p.m.\\nThere is no reason to believe that it is not Ben Allen, particularly if he is referring to a conversation that happened earlier about a bonfire.\\nYou can bring them back in.\\nLAUREN DEAL: December 3, 2016.\\nLAUREN DEAL: 1:49 p.m.\\nMS. BARTHOLOMEW: And who sent that first 
message in State's Exhibit number four?\\nLAUREN DEAL: Remember when I said I was having that bonfire on the 10th?\\nMS. BARTHOLOMEW: And did you ever reply to that message?\\nLAUREN DEAL: Yes, like three hours later.\\nLAUREN DEAL: I don't have a babysitter.\\nMS. BARTHOLOMEW: And 
then was there any conversation after that?\\nLAUREN DEAL: He said, dang, then sent a picture of the bonfire, and then I said, yeah, I know.\\nMS. BARTHOLOMEW: And you earlier stated that you guys had bonfires.\\nWhat Bartholomew actually got from Deal:\\nIdentification of the 
screenshot/date/time and that the first 1:49 p.m. message shows \\u201cBen\\u201d saying: \\u201cRemember when I said I was having that bonfire on the 10th?\\nIt is tonight.\\u201d\\nDeal\\u2019s reply timing and content (4:39 p.m., \\u201cI don\\u2019t have a babysitter\\u201d), 
and brief follow-ups.\\nBartholomew did not elicit an explicit statement from Deal that an earlier conversation actually occurred (e.g., \\u201cYes, we discussed it earlier that day/earlier in the week\\u201d).\\nIn the excerpt, there is no direct Q/A: \\u201cDid you and Ben talk 
about a bonfire before 1:49 that day?\\u201d \\u201cYes.\\u201d \\u2192 Absent.\\nThis is what ADA Bartholomew spent her time on instead of trying to find truth:\\nADA: How did you get to UNC?\\nADA: And other than yourself and your mom, was anybody else in the vehicle?\\nADA: So 
you had mentioned that Mr. DeMarco and his girlfriend had come to CCH.\\nDeal: Maybe ten minutes before we left.\\nDeal: They were not I mean, they stayed she got there to give me pants, but I mean, after that, they didn't stay because they knew they couldn't go to the hospital, and 
I think what happened kind of shook them up quite a bit.\\nDeal: I feel like he was just as scared as I was.\\nI mean, you know, in the car ride to the hospital, you know, he had said that he would not let anything else happen to me.\\nHe would not take me back over there.\\nHis 
girlfriend had been through something similar, and his exact words were, my girlfriend would kill me if I didn't help you.\\nToo Neat in the Emotional Arc\\nShe moves seamlessly from:\\nA fact-like statement (\\u201cthey knew they couldn\\u2019t go to the hospital\\u201d)\\nTo a 
dramatic perception (\\u201che was just as scared as I was\\u201d)\\nTo an exact, cinematic quote (\\u201cmy girlfriend would kill me if I didn\\u2019t help you\\u201d)\\nThat progression is tidy in a way spontaneous recollection usually isn\\u2019t \\u2014 especially under 
courtroom questioning.\\nIt feels constructed to hit emotional beats.\\nIronically, when a witness recalls an exact turn of phrase from a casual conversation during a traumatic moment \\u2014 especially years later \\u2014 it often suggests story reinforcement over time, rather than 
raw memory.\\nShe lacks the self-perception to realize the abomination she has become.\\nTiffany \\u201cNifong\\u201d Bartholomew doesn\\u2019t deserve to be a public servant.\\nI was going to attach it to this email.\\nI was out the following day.\\nNone of it made sense, so I went 
back over the\\u00a0timeline.\\nThey showed a video in court of Lauren arriving at the hospital to meet\\u00a0her mother.\\nFreddie objected to the video, but it was still allowed.\\nI want to know where and when he got this video.\\nI was under the impression that he showed up at 
the hospital that night.\\nIn his arrest warrant he wrote \\u201cUpon arriving at Central Carolina Hospital, her mother recorded her arrival along with Joseph Demarco.\\u201d I am pretty sure he showed up at the hospital that\\u00a0night after Carmen called him.\\nWhen Lauren's 
mother was\\u00a0questioned about the hospital, she was asked if she gave the video to anyone.\\nShe said she gave it to Freeman that night.\\nHe then got off shift, went to his brother's wedding, and then pretended that he got called about some rape.\\nNot only is what Lauren 
described in the house physiologically impossible, but the time doesn't fit either.\\nShe wasn't out stumbling through the woods.\\nNeither of those things could have possibly happened.\\nShe couldn't have done all three.\\nNo one there can reasonably tell how long she was in the 
house.\\nShe used the bathroom, walked out, asked if I wanted a drink of water, then left the room.\\nThat is\\u00a0precisely what happened.\\nI didn't notice that she didn't have pants on because I HAD NO INTEREST IN HER WHATSOEVER.\\nI was trying to lie down to sleep.\\nShe said 
she\\u00a0did not remember if the door was locked.\\nFreeman\\u00a0kept saying that I followed\\u00a0her into the house:\\u00a0(\\\"The victim stated that they requested to use the restroom and was followed in the residence of 94 Beacon Circle by the owner Ben Allen.\\n\\\")She 
didn't say that in either of her interviews.\\nShe said I took her inside.\\nI made sure the door was locked every time I left the house.\\nI confirmed with Morgan that the door was locked before I left this time.\\nSo, how did she get out of the truck and walk into the house?\\nHow 
was it possible that she opened the door and I followed her?\\nShe didn't just walk into the house .\\nHe knows that her story is trash.\\nThere is no\\u00a0other answer to how dumb this shit is, and he still arrested me.\\nMade sure Morgan checked it before I left.\\nFreeman kept 
saying I followed her.\\nHe didn\\u2019t even remember me arriving and calling him again looking for a place to park because he doesn\\u2019t write anything down.\\nI called him because I didn't see a place to park.\\nWe talked briefly and I ended up parking on the road.\\nWhen I 
got off the phone I told him I was on my way\\u00a0 in.\\nWhy wasn't this call recorded?\\nHe was still in the office.\\nI asked if it would be quick because I had to get back to Morgan.\\nI was asking to many questions, so he took me to his office where THERE ARE NO CAMERAS.\\nI 
texted Tiffany and Happel.\\nHe came back and booked me into the jail.\\nThis interview tipped me off, as they knew each other somehow.\\nThe conversation was so familiar.\\nI didn't know they were having family Christmas parties but it didn\\u2019t sound right.\\nIt wasn't just the 
tone or the fact that it seemed somewhat rehearsed.\\nCarmen mentioned Chloe, and he knew who it was without asking for a last name or any amplifying information.\\nHe did the same thing with Tiffany when she mentioned Jolinda.\\nHe knew precisely who Jolinda was when she said 
it.\\nWhen I heard that, I was like, a.)\\nHow does he know Jolinda b.)\\nHow does Tiffany know that he would know who Jolinda was if she mentioned it?\\nI had to look up her last name again while writing that down - Adcock.\\nDo you know why I had to look up her name again?\\nI 
thought for the longest time that Tiffany was just talking because she is Tiffany.\\nIt made sense when I later found out Jolinda actually does have contacts at the Sheriff's office.\\nThe back story between us is that Jolinda and I got into an argument when she was dating my 
ex-wife and asked to drive my kids.\\nShe always nodded out on \\\"zanibars\\\" and had just wrecked her truck.\\nShe seemed not to have to worry about driving under the influence.\\nTiffany told Freeman that I wanted Tiffany to call and ask Jolinda for help.\\nTiffany doesn't think 
through her lies at all.\\nWhy would I ask someone who hates me for help?\\nWhy would I even assume Jolinda would know someone at the Sheriff's\\u00a0office?\\nI thought she was a junky, Why would a junkie have contacts at the police department?\\nRegardless, Carmen lied to him 
also.\\nI think Carmen has some issues.\\nIn the first phone interview she said she knew Joseph.\\nSomeone told her to say that.\\nShe didn\\u2019t even know what any of us looked like.\\nCarmen Love was interviewed on two separate occasions.\\nHaines indicated that Deal had spent 
the evening of October 18 at Goodfellas and Schooly's bars with friends Carmen Love and James, where they later encountered Benjamin Allen (the defendant), Joe DeMarco, and Steve Happel.\\nHe then retrieved video footage from Deal\\u2019s mother showing Deal arriving at Central 
Carolina Hospital (CCH) early on October 19.\\nAllen described their interactions, mentioning she hugged him, and that Deal was \\u201crubbing up on his neck.\\u201d Freeman noted that Allen denied engaging in any sexual contact beyond hugging and kissing\\u200b.\\nHis statement 
detailed an interaction he witnessed between Tiffany Allen and Benjamin Allen, in which Allen reportedly mentioned concerns that Deal's allegations would ruin his life\\u200b.\\nOn the porch, they observed items, including Deal\\u2019s sandals, keys, wallet, and ID.\\nDeal was seen 
consuming multiple drinks.\\n\\u201cRelease me\\u201d implies he felt his freedom was already restricted, physically or by implication.\\n\\\"They are charging you / Yup.\\nHe observed Deal consuming alcohol and recorded her interactions with Allen, which he described as 
\\u201cfriendly.\\u201d\\nFreeman\\u2019s analysis of the footage was used to corroborate Deal\\u2019s account of the evening, though his subjective interpretation of the interactions as \\u201cfriendly\\u201d rather than potentially concerning or predatory could be 
scrutinized.\\nLauren Deal said that she ran up and hugged Mr. Allen when she saw him.\\nThe only hug was after Mr. Allen became upset because she invited herself to his house and didn't leave with her friends.\\nThe hug WAS NOT returned and Mr. Allen backed away.\\nFreeman's 
affidavit said that Lauren went inside the bar and started talking to Mr. Allen Lauren's interview she states that she ran up and gave him a hug and they sat around talking.\\nLauren Deal states in her interview with police that everyone sat down and started drinking to include 
Carmen, James and Peter.\\nShe says that Mr. Allen looks at her and ask her to stay.\\nThe video shows that Peter West leaves and then later Carmen Love and James Morrison leave and Lauren hasn't even talked to anyone yet.\\nLauren Deal testified that she threw her keys to Mr. 
Allen.\\nThe video shows Mr. Allen refusing her keys and her giving them to DeMarco after Mr. Allen says that he isnt' going to be responsible for her since he has his own DD.\\nShe takes her keys to DeMarco and teh video clearly shows her giving her keys to DeMarco.\\nShe said that 
she gave them to Mr. Allen because she trusted him to make sure nothing happened to her.\\nLauren describes herself as being tipsy, feeling good, giggling, laughing.\\nShe is seen multiple times yelling at Mr. Allen, walking around the bar with no shoes and bouncing drunkenly off of 
stools at the bar.\\nLauren testifies to leaving with Ben, Joseph, and Steve and knowing they would be in Ben's truck since Ben made the comment that DeMarco would be driving.\\nLauren Deal left the bar by herself.\\nThis conversation could not have happened.\\nFreeman put in his 
affidavit that they were all talking at schoolies for several hours till 2am before Ben and his friends asked Lauren to come back with them to have a bonfire and she told Carmen that she was leaving with Ben and his friends.\\nCarmen was not even at the bar at 2am.\\nShe had left 
over an hour earlier.\\nThe video, however, shows this did not happen\\u2014there was no initial hug, and the one hug that did occur was brief, unreciprocated, and happened later after Allen became upset.\\nPresence of Friends: Deal described sitting and drinking with her friends, 
including Carmen, James, and Peter, and alleged that Allen asked her to stay.\\nHowever, the video shows that her friends left the bar before she even engaged in significant conversation, and Peter left early.\\nThis contradicts her account and demonstrates a misrepresentation of 
her interactions that night.\\nHandling of Keys: Deal testified that she threw her keys to Allen, stating she trusted him to ensure her safety.\\nThe video, however, shows Allen refusing the keys, with Deal eventually handing them to DeMarco after Allen explicitly stated he was not 
responsible for her.\\nOther Discrepancies:\\nDeal\\u2019s Demeanor and Actions: Deal described herself as tipsy, giggling, and laughing, yet the video shows her as visibly intoxicated\\u2014yelling, walking around barefoot, and stumbling.\\nThis discrepancy between her 
self-reported behavior and what is actually seen on video further challenges her reliability.\\nDeparture from the Bar: Deal testified that she left with Allen, DeMarco, and Happel, and was aware they\\u2019d be traveling in Allen\\u2019s truck with DeMarco driving.\\nHowever, the 
video shows she left alone, making it impossible for any conversation about a designated driver in Allen\\u2019s truck to have taken place.\\nThe video disproves this: Carmen had left over an hour earlier, and no such extended interaction occurred.\\nADA Bartholomew: And were those 
black pants ever sent off to the state crime laboratory?\\nADA Bartholomew: And why was that?\\nLauren Deal and Detective Freeman have the same count of beers but let themselves be off by one on the shots.\\nLauren Deal said he was the drunkest that night.\\nThe video shows that he 
drank the least out of everyone.\\nThe video showed that she gave them to DeMarco.\\n\\u201cTrust/Confidence\\u201d Rebutted by Objective Record\\nVideo shows Mr. Allen avoiding Ms. Deal (even refusing a hug); the witness conceded the closer friendship was with the ex-wife; there 
was a multi-year gap in contact.\\nBeen balls deep in this case.\\nI think I am getting some good stuff together.\\nThen my sister\\u2019s leg is still jacked so mom is up there with her so I run by dads a bit to help him out.\\nYou know how unrganized I am ?\\nCarmen Love was 
interviewed on two separate occasions.\\n*Notes on Peter West and James Morrison\\nPeter West's\\u00a0Identity and Background\\nPeter West was with Lauren Deal's group at Goodfellas and Schooly's bar on the night in question.\\nPeter West has relationships with William Sturkie and 
Brian Estes.\\nCarmen Love was not present either, but she was interviewed.\\nJames Morrison\\u2019s Identity and Background\\nJames Morrison was Carmen Love's boyfriend at the time of the incident.\\nJames Morrison's brother also worked for the city before he passed away.\\nFreeman 
and James Morrison were described as \\\"close and go to family gatherings together.\\\"\\nCarmen Love was not present either, but she was interviewed.\\nSignificance to the Case\\nThey were with Lauren Deal at Goodfellas and Schooly's bar on the night in question.\\nCould have 
provided critical first-hand testimony about Lauren Deal's level of intoxication and behavior.\\nHe interviewed Carmen Love, who was with Lauren for the same duration as James Morrison.\\nCarmen presented a rehearsed story with emotive language.\\nTimeline of Key Events\\nDate of 
Incident, Oct 2019: Alleged events at Goodfellas and Schooly's bar involving Lauren Deal, Benjamin Allen, and others (e.g., Joseph DeMarco, Steve Happel).\\nThe video shows Deal's interactions after 12:45 AM; Carmen Love left at 12:40 AM.\\nWest background from original.\\nMorrison 
ties from original.\\nI also never received Lauren Deal\\u2019s medical records.\\nThe same with the trash from my bathroom that I had bagged to save for the detectives.\\nThe statements about where she ran were disturbing in the fact that they made no sense if she were escaping a 
dangerous situation.\\nShe took a path that made no sense for someone running for their life and was fearful of everyone there.\\nShe described an event that would be impossible to occur between two people.\\nIf I were to have done this, then I would be a danger to the public, so 
why would he do that?\\nHe had surgery scheduled for that Friday.\\nHe also said, \\\"Your son didn't do this, I will say a prayer for him and your family.\\\"\\nShe stated that both counts were 9-3.\\nOur sustainable belief That deconstructing The story that she told Would Very 
easy.\\nThe notable absence of Miss Carmen.\\nThe wild story That she proposed happening In her Phone interview with the private investigator.\\nShe would have been a prom Witness To show the conspiracy.\\nThis would Greatly increase the aperture Of which What questions could have 
been asked, And again, being able to deconstruct the story That they put together to all tell the same Whatever.\\nHe swiped these away In moments.\\nOne of the key points that I keep coming back to Is when he entered the bedroom Were Miss Lauren, Dio had reported this event, had 
occurred, \\n\\nAttorney Crews.\\nAsk him About the processes that he employed within that room.\\nThe only response repeatedly that was given Was he took pictures.\\nHere's why this Part is so critical.\\nThis story has many Unique actors.\\nRegardless of what La she has to tell A 
person she has to betray Or child.\\nShe has to hurt Her single Madness.\\nAnd focus, I'm getting what she wants.\\nAnd at the minimum to be handed that material, it was offered by Miss Allen.\\nAs we can tell from the interaction between Miss Allen on her first phone call with 
detective Freeman, When Miss Alan Menson mentioned someone named jolinda.\\nWho this Jolinda is Wong Salon thought it important to bring to Linda up to detective Freeman.\\nNever ask, Who the student person was.\\nWe still don't understand.\\nRelationship between these parties 
involved.\\nThat her friends at the police department Would take care of it.\\nI do want to know How he knows Jo Linda For the record.\\nMiss Tiffany Allen had dated Miss Jelinda Adcock During Their marital separation.\\nMr. Allen became aware of the fact that Joe Linda had wrecked 
her vehicle.\\nUnder the influence Of something called zany bars.\\nGod behavior of her, passing out and drooling onto the bar Led to her also driving a vehicle In the same state Once Mr. Allen learned of this.\\nThat this was a severe addiction That would possibly lead Turn.\\nHis 
only hope Was to exclude his children From a possible negative outcome By writing in the vehicle with someone Who was struggling with addiction On something that's powerful.\\nAs these zany bars, He had seen the effects Of these On Mr. Linda himself.\\nHe had witnessed her Laid out 
on the bar, Passed out.\\nGroggy Not herself, Not someone It would be aware And caring While his children Or passengers in her vehicle.\\nThis apparently Created a rift That was unrepairable.\\nA rift That must have been so bad.\\nThat Joe Linda involved herself.\\nBecause Dur 
Tiffany, Allen's Outburst And in anger, she stated That she had talked to jolinda And it didn't matter.\\nEven after hearing this come out of Tiffany's mouth Mr. Allen Steele With somewhat in a state of disbelief because Miss Allen says, a lot of things that aren't true.\\nIt is 
weighed By those relationships that you've built over a lifetime of growing up in a small town.\\nWe can all see the advantage Of doing a favor for a friend Of helping someone out Of being someone there for someone in their time of need.\\nA single father Whose children have lost 
her mother.\\nOne's Community Should be healed.\\nMiss Lauren deal Didn't need help.\\nIt wasn't a sexual assault kit that she needed.\\nIt was mental health support that she required.\\nWe heard about her past experiences in school and how she was picked on and Had to find another 
way in which to move through that environment.\\nWe know about the mental health medications that she's on now.\\nThose medications are what she Should never been drinking on in the first place.\\nBut she made a decision that night.\\nIs our belief that Once she found herself in 
that position And Mr. Ellen not willing to participate.\\nIt wasn't just Anger That came across her.\\nWhat if a friend Tiffany Found out?\\nShe saw that Mr. Allen was not interested In her.\\nSo, why would he not bring this up the following day To his wife, his ex-wife?\\nThe anger 
may have been bearable, But the embarrassment Was not.\\nAll those times that she was made fun of came back again.\\nAnd now I can see herself.\\nShe was teased were true Because in her mind She was to climb in that bed with Ms Rowell.\\nAnd when he refused any advance on her part 
at all.\\nThe only thing she had Was a realization That she's a fucking piece of shit.\\n}\\n      ]\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\\"name\\\": \\\"Ms. Allen\\\",\\n      \\\"mentions\\\": [\\n        {\\n          \\\"action_phrase\\\": \\\"has passed away\\\",\\n

was convinced that this was a women and I was cheating on her.\\nNOV 10 \\u2013 NOV 21, 2014 \\u2013 I sent Tiffany links about the impacts of marijuana on someone who has mental help issues.\\nShe said she never read them.\\nShe was talking about a friend of hers that was getting 
cheated on by her husband and was asking me how she could report it to his work.\\nHe works for the CIA so I told her to report it to the Inspector General.\\nShe told me how he and her girlfriend was breaking into Amy\\u2019s Facebook account, stalking her, and making threats.\\nI 
even talked to Amy on the phone to encourage her to let her know it would be ok.\\nI think this was all a ploy to distract me and get information about how she could report me for cheating on her.\\nI didn\\u2019t think about his until later.\\nThey asked all kinds of questions, 
talked about how Amy used devices around the house to spy on him, how bad he treated her, all kinds of stuff that still just seems like WAY too similar to be a coincidence.\\nMid November 2015 \\u2013 I got a call at when I left work with Tiffany screaming.\\nShe said Lukas was hurt 
bad and Morgan also.\\nI asked what happened but she just said, \\u201cI hate you!\\nThis is all your fault!\\u201d she then hung up on me.\\nI tried to call a couple of times.\\nShe answered once and said something about Lukas\\u2019s eye.\\nI got home and went to see the 
kids.\\nThey were pretty scuffed up but seemed ok.  Lukas had road rash on his face, arm and leg.\\nMorgan was scraped up on her leg and said her crotch hurt.\\nI immediately put them in my car and Tiff and I went to the Emergicare in Sanford by the PapaJohn\\u2019s.\\nThey checked 
out and the doctor said they looked ok.\\nI asked Tiffany what had happened when I had gotten home.\\nShe said Morgan had kept bugging her about riding the go-cart and she was trying to talk on the phone so she couldn\\u2019t deal with it.\\nShe said she got tired of hearing it so 
she said that she could ride it with Lukas.\\nI couldn\\u2019t believe what I was hearing.\\nShe said it was my fault since I had bought it for them\\u2026  Morgan was asking because no one was supposed to be on it unless one of us was outside.\\nEveryone knew this\\u2026that is why 
she asked.\\nAll Tiffany had to do was go outside with her and show her the area they were restricted to riding since Brendan and Carter had their accident.\\nThey were only allowed to ride in a circle in the front yard.\\nMorgan was asking \\u2013 following the rules.\\nI 
don\\u2019t understand why Tiff let her ride it or how it became my fault when I wasn\\u2019t even home.\\nNOV 30th 2014\\u2013 Tiffany\\u2019s parents were in for Thanksgiving.\\nWhen I got up Tiffany and her mother were sitting at the table.\\nI asked where Dan (her step-father) 
was at.\\nShe said that he was out getting the RV ready for their trip.\\nI went outside to assist if I could.\\nEverything seemed a little different but no one was saying much.\\nI just assumed it was because they were leaving after staying the week of Thanksgiving.\\nThe kids were 
getting in the RV.\\nTiff said that they were going to ride down the road with her parents and that she would pick them up.\\nI said that she could ride with them also and I would come get them instead of her driving separate.\\nI could stay and she would go get them.\\nShe 
didn\\u2019t come back for hours.\\nI texted her a couple of times when it started to get late.\\nShe responded with something and she came home a while later.\\nThis is when she announced to me that she had listened to recordings with her mother and father that contained 
\\u201cproof\\u201d that I was abusing the children.\\nShe said that Dan didn\\u2019t believe it but he couldn\\u2019t wait to get out of there.\\nThe morning started making a little more sense.\\nShe said that she had spent the day at the Sherriff\\u2019s office with a detective 
and the FBI.\\nShe said that she had turned over recordings, my computer, etc.\\nWe argued for a few minutes.\\nI finally gave up trying to talk to her.\\nI said that whatever she was going through that I would help her through it.\\nAt this point I went into the living room to get 
away from the situation.\\nShe came in crying saying she was sorry and didn\\u2019t know why I loved her so much.\\nI let her lay there but told her that I didn\\u2019t really feel like touching her.\\nWe ended up going to bed together about an hour later.\\nShe laid down in bed 
with me and we tried to sleep.\\nThe kids were getting up from bed so I just asked them all to grab their stuff so they could come in the room with us.\\nThey had heard us arguing earlier and she had accused me of abuse so I thought that it would be good if we all slept in the room 
together.\\nShe got up the next morning and flipped out about all the kids being in the room.\\nI didn\\u2019t get this since she was talking to them when they were bringing their covers and pillows into the room.\\nShe acted like she wasn\\u2019t aware that they were there the 
entire night.\\nI received a call when I got out of work from Diana Anderson (DSS) asking me to stay at a hotel.\\nShe wanted to do an intake interview before I could go back into the house.\\nI located a hotel and rented a room.\\nAfter work I drive to Sanford to meet with Diana 
Anderson.\\nAfter the intake she told me that I could go back to the house.\\nShe called Tiffany to ask her if it was ok.\\nI could hear Tiffany disagreeing with that.\\nTiffany said that her parents would pay for the hotel room if I didn\\u2019t come home.\\nI didn\\u2019t want to 
make things worse so I agreed to stay in a hotel again.\\nSince this was the last night on the Safety Plan I thought that it would give Tiffany time to calm down.\\nI didn\\u2019t see anything good coming from me being at the house with her in that state of mind.\\nWhen I got home 
no one was there.\\nI called Tiffany\\u2019s mother and she didn\\u2019t answer.\\nI then called Tiffany\\u2019s step-father.\\nHe answered and I told him my concerns about the children not being there.\\nWe both know that Tiffany has mental issues.\\nAbout the time that I hung up, 
Tiffany called.\\nShe said that she wasn\\u2019t coming home.\\nShe was saying that Carter thought that I was going to come into the house and kill everyone.\\nShe then said that she was getting a police escort.\\nI waited for her to get home with the escort.\\nShe didn\\u2019t show 
for a while so I called dispatch asking if the officer would come by the house.\\nOfficer Brewer called me saying that he was on his way.\\nHe told me that Tiffany was going to a hotel.\\nSince there was no order of any kind for me not to be there, he said it was ok for me to 
stay.\\nI asked if it ok to enter the house and he said that it was fine.\\nI went inside and Tiffany began to text me.\\nShe said that I wasn\\u2019t supposed to be at the house due to the order that I signed at DSS.\\nI explained that it wasn\\u2019t true.\\nShe was getting upset 
so I just stopped texting her.\\nThey had no record of me, Tiffany or my children.\\nShe said that even if it was approved that I didn\\u2019t know where she was anyway.\\nI had told her during our discussion that this was the case.\\nI left to go get some breakfast since I 
wasn\\u2019t getting anywhere.\\nI was driving down the road when I got a text from my boss.\\nThis was by the hotel that we had stayed in when we first came to Sanford.\\nI thought that I would check to see if my kids were there.\\nI drove through the parking lot and left.\\nI 
immediately received a text from Tiffany asking what I was doing there.\\nAfter about 10-15 minutes the lady at the desk received a call.\\nI could hear Tiff on the other end of the line.\\nShe was telling the lady that I was outside her hotel room.\\nThe lady asked her if she had 
contacted the police, what kind of car, etc.\\nAbout the time that Tiffany got off the phone, Diana was available to see me.\\nI met with her briefly before going back down to the courthouse.\\nI told her where I was at and why.\\nI was sitting outside the courthouse when Tiffany 
pulled in with the kids.\\nI saw her walking around the front of the building.\\nI assumed she didn\\u2019t know where the sheriff\\u2019s office was located.\\nI walked around the front but realized that I had my phone in my pocket.\\nI returned it to my car and then went back 
around the front.\\nI entered and talked to the kids a moment before being arrested.\\nDEC 5th \\u2013 13th 20014\\u2013 I stayed with a friend down in Fayetteville during this time.\\nHe was getting ready to deploy so I couldn\\u2019t stay with him that long before he had to 
leave.\\nDEC 14th thru the 18th 2014\\u2013 My mother came in so we stayed at a hotel this week.\\nTiffany and mom communicated but mostly she was telling mom that she couldn\\u2019t see the kids.\\nDEC 19th 2014- My mom had been in town all week and hadn't had a chance to see the 
kids.\\nShe had been talking with Tiff all week trying to figure out when she could come by.\\nMy mother had went to the house on the first night and Tiffany wouldn't let her see them or let her in the house.\\nBy Friday we were ready to leave so we could do Christmas back home in 
KY.\\n(Psychologist recommended through work to help me deal with the situation)  Mom decided that she was going to go by the house to see the kids.\\nShe asked me about it and I said that it would be ok since she wasn't restricted by the conditions of my release.\\nI thought that 
it would be a good idea to drop off the presents since the kids could have them for Christmas and it would give her more room in her trunk if we stopped to finish up shopping in Nashville.\\n(We didn't end up going that way home.)\\nI was at the gas station across from the Tramway 
shopping center when mom got to our house.\\nShe said they were getting ready to leave.\\nI thought that I could grab a couple of things if they weren't going to be there.\\nMom called me back and said that my ex-wife had come out on the porch.\\nI said that my ex-wife was there and 
didn't know how this was going to go.\\nThe dispatcher told me that someone would meet me at Beacon Circle.\\nBeacon Circle is really close to the house so I drove to the end of Aviation Lane to meet the officer and take advisement from there.\\nI still had about 40 minutes before 
my appointment but it was getting close to whether I could grab some stuff before leaving or not.\\nNext thing I know Tiffany pulls up beside me and starts cussing and yelling at me.\\nEssentially all hell broke loose.\\nOur dog comes running up the road, the van door opens and I 
see my oldest son crying, (I found out later that he had broken his wrist) mom is out of the car beside the van.\\nTiff grabs my mom (left bruises on her arms - she is 65) and is yelling along my ex-wife are yelling.\\n(HWY1)  I get out of the car and tell him that my ex-wife left 
with my son.\\nI didn't know what else to say.\\nI was pretty shaken up about what had just happened and seeing my ex-wife there.\\nI had no idea why she was there and assumed that she was going to leave with Brendan.\\nThat wouldn't have been good in my opinion.\\nI did ask my son 
if he was ok when the van door opened.\\nMom asked him if he wanted to come with Nana and he said that it was fine - he would stay.\\nI left immediately to go back to KY.  We stayed at a hotel somewhere in NC.\\nNo one was allowed to talk to kids \\u2013 not even their cousins.\\nI 
was able to get visitation at this point.\\nI got to see the kids that night.\\nMy mother was able to go to pick up the kids so they could come see me.\\nJAN 28th 2015\\u2013 I found out later that Sara had contacted DSS about her concerns about Tiffany.\\nShe came over that evening 
to take my statement.\\nShe said that Brendan and Lukas claimed that I had abused them.\\nI got more information on this later from Sara who had stayed in the house with Tiffany at multiple times over the past few weeks.\\nFEB 3rd \\u2013 I went with Sara to DSS today.\\nShe told 
DSS a bunch of things that happened while she was there that changed her mind about what was going on.\\nIt was hard to listen too.\\nI got to meet the foster parents.\\nWe were separated, she was on heavy medication for Stage 4 lung cancer, and she was severely mentally ill. She 
brought up previous accusations about abuse of our children.\\nThe fact that this wasn\\u2019t done put my children at risk.\\nSince we were separated, I was unaware of her state of mind.\\nI had let her borrow my phone.\\nIt was returned when she passed away.\\nIt was $5,000 out of 
my pocket and possibly the smoking gun on me being set up.\\nHer tactic of delay has the intended impact.\\nTiffany's Text Messages from Missing Phone (See attachments)\\nIf they had wanted to assess the integrity of Tiffany\\u2019s statements, then they could have contacted the 
children.\\nINTRODUCTION TO CHARACTERS\\nBenjamin Allen \\u2013 Myself\\nLauren Deal -Accuser\\nCarmen Love is a female friend/cousin of Lauren Deal.\\nSpent the evening drinking with Deal at Goodfellas and Schooley\\u2019s.\\nJames Morrison \\u2013 Boyfriend of Carmen Love.\\nSpent
