[[AI Case Review ]] 
Trial  counsel are granted  wide  latitude  in  the scope  of  jury argument, and control of closing arguments is in the discretion of the trial court.
Further, for an inappropriate prosecutorial comment to justify  a new trial, it "must be sufficiently grave that it is prejudicial  error."
"In deciding whether the trial court improperly failed to intervene ex mero  motu to correct an allegedly  improper argument of  counsel at final argument, our review is limited to discerning whether the statements were  so grossly improper that  the  trial judge  abused  his  discretion in failing to intervene."
The statute pertaining to change of venue motions provides:
If, upon  motion  of  the defendant, the  court  determines that there exists in the county in which the prosecution is pending so great  a  prejudice  against the  defendant  that he  cannot  obtain  a fair and impartial trial, the court must either:
 (1)  Transfer  the proceeding  to another  county  in the prosecutorial  district  as defined  in  G.S.
he power and effectiveness of a closing argument is a vital part of the adversarial process that forms the basis of  our justice system.
A well-reasoned, well-articulated  closing argument can be a critical part of  winning a case.
However, such argument, no matter how effective, must: (I) be devoid of counsel's personal opinion;
 (2)  avoid name-calling  and/or references to matters beyond the record; 
 (3) be premised on logical deductions, not on appeals to passion  or prejudice; and
 (4)  be  constructed from fair inferences  drawn  only  from  evidence  properly  admitted  at  trial.
Moreover,  professional  decorum  requires  that  tactics  such  as name-calling  and showmanship must defer to a higher standard.
There are many situations in which a district attorney may deem it advisable to initiate criminal proceedings by indictment, e.g., where there is no fear of flight by a defendant, or where there exists a need for confidentiality to avoid needless harm to the reputation of a prospective accused.
In such instances, a prosecutor may elect to eschew the needless waste of judicial and prosecutorial resources which an unnecessary probable cause hearing would engender.
Since the availability of this discretion to a district attorney bears a rational relationship to a legitimate governmental objective, i.e., the more efficient administration of criminal justice, it is not subject to constitutional challenge.

Criminal Law § 34.4— evidence of other offenses committed by defendant— admissibility to show intent, motive, common scheme or plan 7.
Criminal Law § 102.5— prosecutor’s conduct in examining witness Every criminal defendant is entitled to have a fair trial which is conducted before an impartial judge and unprejudiced jury in an atmosphere of calm deliberation.
2d 561 (1971).The obligation to take steps to assure a defendant’s right to a fair trial rests upon the shoulders of both the presiding judge and the district attorney.
2d 762 (1954).However, it should be noted that the obligation of the district attorney to conduct himself in such a manner as to assure the right to a fair trial does in no way lessen his obligation to the state to prosecute criminal charges to the best of his abilities on the basis of the evidence that he is able to bring before the jury.
Accordingly, counsel is given wide latitude in the argument of hotly contested trials, subject to the exercise of the sound discretion of the presiding judge.
The district attorney has the right and the duty to cross-examine vigorously a defendant who takes the stand in his own defense, State v. Ross, 275 N.C. 550, 169 S.E.
The district attorney’s performance of his duties as public prosecutor is tempered by his obligation to the defendant to assure that he is afforded his right to a fair trial.
Therefore, he may not, by argument or by cross-examination, place before the jury incompetent and prejudicial matters.
This rule is violated by asking questions which are phrased impertinently or insultingly so as to badger or humiliate a witness.
2d 604 (1965).The test that is to be applied is whether the evidence tends to shed any light upon the subject matter of the inquiry or has as its only effect the exciting of prejudice or sympathy.
Police or Prosecutor Misconduct Is at Root of Half of Exoneration Cases, Study Finds Official misconduct played a role in the criminal convictions of more than half of innocent people who were later exonerated, according to a new report by a registry that tracks wrongful convictions.
“Official misconduct damages truth-seeking by our criminal justice system and undermines public confidence,” Samuel Gross, a professor emeritus of law at the University of Michigan and the report’s lead author, said in a statement on Tuesday.
“The great majority of wrongful convictions are never discovered, so the scope of the problem is much greater than these numbers show.” The study, which is based on 2,400 exonerations recorded in the registry from 1989 until early 2019, found that prosecutors and police officers committed misconduct at comparable rates (30 percent and 34 percent).
In federal cases, however, prosecutors “committed misconduct more than twice as often as police,” especially in federal white-collar cases in which they “committed misconduct seven times as often as police,” according to the report.
The report details the different types of misconduct that can occur at different stages of a case.
Nearly all of the official misconduct identified falls into five general categories: witness tampering, misconduct in interrogations, fabricating evidence, concealing exculpatory evidence and misconduct at trial.
“As few police officers as there are who are arrested and convicted of official misconduct, there are almost no prosecutors” who face such consequences, Mr. Feinman said, adding, “I’ve never heard of any prosecutor being arrested for misconduct, and almost no prosecutors are fired or disbarred for misconduct.” Jeffrey Bellin, a professor at William & Mary Law School in Williamsburg, Va., and a former prosecutor, called the trial of an innocent person “the most important test of our criminal justice system.” He said it was not surprising that “when the system fails that test by convicting someone who is innocent, police and prosecutors are often implicated in that failure.” “At the same time, this is a part of the problem that can most easily be fixed,” Professor Bellin said.
“Prosecutors need to see themselves as part of a system that does justice, not as unilaterally responsible for convicting those who they perceive to be guilty.” Speedy trial The prosecutorial indifference and the judicial intemperance manifested in this colloquy is neither condoned nor approved.
Defendant again maintains that the district attorney improperly injected facts outside the record inapposite The cases principally relied upon by defendant are clearly in-apposite, and the reasoning of those cases simply cannot be stretched to encompass the imaginative and innovative standard of double jeopardy which defendant seeks to impose request for change of venue request sanctions against DA 
Where the United States Supreme Court has said the federal constitution does not prohibit the use of absolute prosecutorial discretion in determining which cases to prosecute for first degree murder so long as such discretionary decisions are not based on race, religion, or some other impermissible classification, the North Carolina Supreme Court is not inclined to interpret our state constitution to require more.
Therefore, defendant’s argument that our death penalty statute violates the equal protection of the laws clause of the Fourteenth Amendment because it afforded the district attorney “unbridled” discretion in deciding against whom he will seek verdicts of first degree murder and the death penalty must fail where defendant failed to show that the district attorney based his decision to seek the death penalty in defendant’s case upon unjustifiable standards like “race, religion or other arbitrary classification.” Id.
denied, 446 U.S. 941 (1980), the defendant claimed our death penalty procedure denied defendants constitutional due process because it placed no limits on the case calendaring prerogatives of the district attorney, who could, according to defendant, “calendar cases when he chooses, in front of whatever judge he chooses.” In rejecting this argument, we said: Our courts have recognized that there may be selectivity in prosecutions and that the exercise of this prosecutorial prerogative does not reach constitutional proportion unless there be a showing that the selection was deliberately based upon ‘an unjustifiable standard such as race, religion or other arbitrary classification.’ Citations, including Oyler, omitted.
The United States Supreme Court has rejected arguments identical to defendant’s in the context of death penalty procedures.
Defendant fails to show that the district attorney based his decision to seek the death penalty in defendant’s or any other death case upon unjustifiable standards like “race, religion or other arbitrary classification.” The United States Supreme Court says the federal constitution does not prohibit the use of absolute prosecutorial discretion in determining which cases to prosecute for first degree murder so long as such discretionary decisions are not based on race, religion, or some other impermissible classification.
We are not inclined to interpret our state constitution to require more.2 The Court then stated that “the due process inquiry must consider the reasons for the delay as well as the prejudice to the accused.” Id.
In determining whether the defendant in the present case is entitled to dismissal of the charges against him for violation of his constitutional due process right to a speedy trial, we must first consider the reasons for the pre-indictment delay.
It is clear, however, that the State’s decision to postpone indictment until 1981 was sound.
In Lovasco, the United States Supreme Court wrote: “In our view, investigative delay is fundamentally unlike delay undertaken by the Government solely ‘to gain tactical advantage over the accused’ .
In a pre-Lovasco case, this Court recognized the legitimacy of pre-indictment investigative delay, stating that “the legitimate need to protect the existence of an ongoing undercover investigation from exposure has been frequently recognized by the federal courts as a reasonable justification for delay in bringing an indictment.” State v. Dietz, 289 N.C. 488, 492, 223 S.E.
Comment: The responsibility of a public prosecutor, which for these purposes includes a government lawyer having a prosecutorial role, differs from that of the usual advocate; his duty is to seek justice, not merely to convict.
This special duty exists because
   (1) the prosecutor represents the sovereign and therefore should use restraint in the discretionary exercise of government powers, such as in the selection of cases to prosecute; 
   (2) during trial the prosecutor is not only an advocate but he also may make decisions normally made by an individual client, and those affecting the public interest should be fair to all; and 
   (3) in our system of criminal justice the accused is to be given the benefit of all reasonable doubts.
With respect to evidence and witnesses, the prosecutor has responsibilities different from those of a lawyer in private practice; the prosecutor should make timely disclosure to the defense of available evidence, known to him, that tends to negate the guilt of the accused, mitigate the degree of the offense, or reduce the punishment.
Further, a prosecutor should not intentionally avoid pursuit of evidence merely because he believes it will damage the prosecutor’s case or aid the accused.
The exception in paragraph (D) recognizes that a prosecutor may seek an appropriate protective order from the tribunal if disclosure of information to the defense could result in substantial harm to an individual or to the public interest.
RULE 7.2 Representing the Client Within the Bounds of the Law 
   (A) In his representation of a client, a lawyer shall not: 
   (1) File a suit, assert a position, conduct a defense, controvert an issue, delay a trial, or take other action on behalf of his client when he knows or when it is obvious that such action would be frivolous or would serve merely to harass or maliciously injure another.
(2) Knowingly advance a claim or defense that is unwarranted under existing law, except that he may advance such claim or defense if it can be supported by good faith argument for an extension, modification, or reversal of existing law.
A lawyer for the defendant in a criminal proceeding, or the respondent in a proceeding that could result in incarceration, may nevertheless so defend as to require that every element of the case against his client be established.
(3) Conceal or knowingly fail to disclose that which he is required by law to reveal.
(4)) Knowingly make a false statement of law or fact.
(5) Knowingly use perjured testimony or false evidence.
(7) Unlawfully obstruct another party’s access to evidence or unlawfully alter, destroy or conceal a document or other material having potential evidentiary value.
(8) Counsel or assist his client in conduct that the lawyer knows to be illegal or fraudulent.
(9) Knowingly engage in other illegal conduct or conduct contrary to a Disciplinary Rule.
(B) A lawyer who receives information clearly establishing that: 
   (1) His client intends to or has, in the course of the representation, perpetrated a fraud upon a person or tribunal shall promptly call upon his client to rectify the same, and, if the client refuses or is unable to do so, he shall discontinue his representation of the client in that matter; and if the representation involves litigation, the lawyer shall (if applicable rules require) request the tribunal to permit him to withdraw, but without necessarily revealing his reason for wishing to withdraw.
(2) A person other than his client has perpetrated a fraud upon a tribunal shall promptly reveal the fraud to the tribunal.
The advocate’s task is to present the client’s case with persuasive force.
Performance of that duty while maintaining confidences of the client is qualified by the advocate’s duty of candor to the tribunal.
However, an advocate does not vouch for the evidence submitted in a cause; the tribunal is responsible for assessing its probative value.
An advocate is responsible for pleadings and other documents prepared for litigation, but is usually not required to have personal knowledge of matters asserted therein, for litigation documents ordinarily present assertions by the client, or by someone on the client’s behalf, and not assertions by the lawyer.
However, an assertion purporting to be of the lawyer’s own knowledge, as in an affidavit by the lawyer or in a statement in open court, may properly be made only when the lawyer knows the assertion is true or believes it to be true on the basis of a reasonably diligent inquiry.
The obligation prescribed in Rule 7.1(A)(4)not to counsel a client to commit or assist the client in committing a fraud applies in litigation.
If the false evidence is introduced before the lawyer discovers its falsity, the lawyer shall reveal the fraud to the tribunal.
When false evidence is offered by the client, however, a conflict may arise between the lawyer’s duty to keep the client’s revelations confidential and the duty of candor to the court.
If the persuasion is ineffective, the lawyer must seek to withdraw.
The prosecutor in a criminal or quasi-criminal case shall: 
   (A) Refrain from prosecuting a charge that he knows is not supported by probable cause, unless otherwise directed by statutory mandate; 
   (B) Make reasonable efforts to assure that the accused has been advised of the right to, and the procedure for obtaining, counsel and has been given reasonable opportunity to obtain counsel; 
   (C) Not seek to obtain from an unrepresented accused a waiver of important pretrial rights, such as the right to a preliminary hearing; 
   (D) Make timely disclosure to the defense of all evidence or information known to him that tends to negate the guilt of the accused or mitigates the offense, and, in connection with sentencing, disclose to the defense and to the tribunal all unprivileged mitigating information known to him, except when he is relieved of this responsibility by a protective order of the tribunal; and 
   (E) Exercise reasonable care to prevent investigators, law enforcement personnel, employees, or other persons assisting or associated with him from making an extrajudicial statement that he would be prohibited from making under Rule 7.7.
Particular Presumptions Where there is evidence that defendant has committed a robbery with what appears to the victim to be a firearm or other dangerous weapon and nothing to the contrary appears in evidence, the presumption that the § 34.7.
Admissibility of Evidence of Other Offenses to Show Intent In a prosecution for first-degree sexual offense and for taking indecent liberties with a child, there was no error in permitting the victim’s brother and another child to testify about incidents with defendant other than those for which defendant was charged.
Defendant’s Motion for Transcript The retrial of an indigent defendant on rape, burglary and larceny charges without providing him with a transcript of his original trial was error entitling him to a new trial.
Prosecutorial Misconduct Cases And Examples June 4, 2020 By Samuel Partida, Jr. What is prosecutorial misconduct?
If you ask most criminal defendants they’d tell you if you want to see an an example of prosecutorial misconduct all you have to do is look at his case.
The law, in fact, gives prosecutors wide latitude to operate and it takes pretty obvious and egregious conduct before a court will finds that prosecutorial misconduct has occurred.
Prosecutorial Misconduct A prejudicial denial of due process can occur where an indictment is procured through prosecutorial misconduct.
“The due process rights of a defendant may be violated if the prosecutor deliberately or intentionally misleads the grand jury, uses known perjured or false testimony, or presents other deceptive or inaccurate evidence.” Oliver, 368 Ill. App.
Therefore, prosecutorial misconduct is a general description of wrong doing by a prosecutorial, but a defendant has to point to some prejudice before he can ask for a dismissal or a suppression of evidence.
To warrant dismissal of the indictment, the denial of due process must be unequivocally clear, and the prejudice must be actual and substantial.
Prosecutorial misconduct resulting in a due process violation is actually and substantially prejudicial only if the grand jury would not have otherwise indicted the defendant.
In a grand jury room prejudice is shown if the evidence was so weak that the misconduct induced the grand jury to indict.
3d at 697-98. n law, sua sponte (Latin: "of his, her, its or their own accord") or suo motu ("on its own motion") describes an act of authority taken without formal prompting from another party.
The term is usually applied to actions by a judge taken without a prior motion or request from the parties.
suborned perjury 1We acknowledge the principle discussed in the special concurrence–credibility determinations are to be made by the trier of fact.
Again, because we are at first stage, we accept the affidavit as true.
In reviewing a postconviction petition, it is the role of the trial court to act as the trier of fact, making credibility determinations, deciding the weight to give testimony and evidence, and resolving evidentiary conflicts.
Hammond’s affidavit is sufficient to survive first stage due to the fact it contains an allegation that he was under instruction, inferentially by  a  prosecuting  entity,  to  omit  certain  highly  relevant  facts.
at  the  second  stage  if  the  judge  ruling  on  the  postconviction  petition  presided  over  the defendant’s trial, or at the third stage if someone other than the trial judge rules on the petition.
3d at 40.25While I agree with the majority that defendant’s postconviction petition is sufficient to survive  the  first  stage  of  postconviction  proceedings,  I  disagree  with  the  majority’s characterization of Hammond’s testimony as “unreliable.” The reliability or  unreliability  of Hammond’s testimony is to be determined by the trial court, acting as the trier of fact, at the second  or  third  stage  of  postconviction  proceedings.
Failing to correct trial testimony known to be perjured by a government witness.
Finally, the analysis in the investigation’s report should include a fair observation of the investigator’s performance—how he or she handled and analyzed evidence and intelligence—and consider how that performance affected, both positively and negatively, the investigation’s conclusions.
As an investigator, however, it can lead to disastrous results.
In simple terms, confirmation bias occurs when you develop a hypothesis and then view the evidence in a light that helps confirm that hypothesis.
The job of an investigator, however, is to gather and evaluate all evidence from which an objective conclusion can be reached.
Witness tampering:
    When it comes to most criminal investigations, police officers owe a duty to the public at large, not to any particular individuals.
If police do investigate, they still have no duty to follow up on every lead or expend every resource in a criminal investigation.
Because no duty of care is owed to a particular victim, victims generally don't have any legal recourse in court, even when police were negligent in their investigation or in failing to investigate (absent extraordinary circumstances discussed below).
File a Complaint With Internal Affairs, Police Disciplinary Board, or a Governing Body An aggrieved victim or witness who believes police engaged in misconduct or were negligent in their investigation may file a complaint with one or more of the following: the internal affairs department for the law enforcement agency a state or local police disciplinary board a state or local citizen oversight board, or the U.S. Department of Justice or a state human rights department (to report civil rights violations).
A victim could also file a complaint with the local or state governing body that oversees and funds the law enforcement agency.
For instance, a person could raise issues relating to a police department with the city council.
Remedies Available Through Complaints on Police Officers The available remedies will usually depend on the authority granted to these agencies or departments.
It's possible a complaint could start the wheels of justice and push the police to conduct or reopen an investigation.
The complaint might also lead to an investigation of the police officer's conduct or department policies and procedures.
If an oversight board or agency determines an officer was negligent or engaged in misconduct or unethical behavior, it might issue one or more of the following disciplinary actions: oral or written remand suspension with or without pay demotion mandatory training decertification (take away their officer licensing or certification), or termination.
In egregious cases, an officer could be charged with a criminal offense, such as misconduct of a public officer, harassment, illegally concealing or tampering with evidence, or making threats.
Civil Rights Violations and Discrimination If an officer's failure to investigate a crime takes the form of discrimination, a person may have a civil rights action against the officer or the department.
For instance, if police routinely fail to investigate domestic violence reports made by Black women, a victim might be able to prove this inaction amounts to racial and gender discrimination—a violation of equal protection under the law.
Another example would be the failure of police to investigate suspected murders of missing Indigenous women.
In these types of cases, a person could file a federal or state civil rights action.
These lawsuits can be difficult to win but monetary damages are possible if successful.
In cases where a police agency, as a whole, engages in discriminatory investigative practice, the attorney general can sue the agency and ask the court to order the agency to change its practices (usually through a plan overseen by a court and the Justice Department).
Police may also be subject to criminal prosecution and penalties for depriving a person of their constitutional rights.
CAUSES OF POLICE OFFICER INADEQUACY IN INVESTIGATIONS The term "failure to investigate properly" covers several issues related to the police force's inadequate handling of a case.
This can include any of the following: Failure to secure a crime scene.
Failure to maintain the appropriate chain of custody.
The unlawful searching of you or your property.
Failure to serve a suspect their Miranda rights upon arrest.
The use of excessive force.
Sexual assault or sexual coercion by a law enforcement officer.
Other certain circumstances where your rights are violated.
A situation where you were discriminated against by police.
One of our country's basic constitutional rights is that a person cannot be arrested and charged with a crime without being served Miranda warnings.
Miranda rights are when, upon a suspect's arrest, the arresting officer explains to the suspect that he or she has the fifth Amendment right not to make incriminating statements about themself.
The Miranda rights that must be given upon a suspect's arrest are: The right to remain silent.
The warning that any statement they make can be used against them in a court of law.
The right to an attorneyand this right includes a court-appointed public defender if they cannot afford to secure their own private legal counsel.
In addition to Miranda warnings, the police must adhere to ethical guidelines like having probable cause when searching a suspect or their property as well as either consent to search or a search warrant that gives them the legal right to search.
For example, if you are charged with the intent to sell drugs, but the search of your vehicle where they found the drugs was searched without probable cause, consent, or a search warrantthen you may have a case against the arresting officer.
Failing To Maintain The Chain Of Custody When evidence is collected at a crime scene, it's vital that the police officers at the scene follow the proper chain of custody for evidence.
What this means is that there are specific guidelines on how to handle, document, and store evidence from the scene of a crime.
If throughout a criminal investigation, a police officer fails to maintain the pre-established chain of custody, they have failed to properly investigate the crime.
Examples of errors in maintaining the chain of custody are: Not securing evidence properly, for instance not tagging or bagging it.
Not restricting who handles or sees the evidence.
When there is a failure to maintain the chain of custody, a judge may rule that the evidence cannot be brought before the court.
This means that valuable evidence that could secure a conviction would not be allowed to be referenced in court due to the mistake of the officer.
Failing To Properly Collect Evidence Failing to collect evidence from the scene that may pertain to the investigation can make a huge impact on any investigation.
The type of evidence that can be collected at a crime scene are: Fingerprints Footprints Hair Nails Blood Other cell tissue from a victim or perpetrator Weapons Residue from guns Fire accelerants Drugs or alcohol If any evidence is missed or if the evidence is not handled with care, it can lead to the arrest of the wrong person or result in no arrest at all for a crime committed against you.
Failing To Secure The Crime Scene After police are called to the scene of a crime, it is the responsibility of the very first officer on the scene to secure the crime scene.
What this means is that as soon as law enforcement arrives at the scene, they must establish a marked barrier to limit anyone other than investigators from interacting with the crime scene.
If anyone tampers with evidence or there is DNA left behind from individuals present at the crime scene due to the first officer on the scene failing to secure the scene, it can lead to life-changing false imprisonments or the failure to collect evidence that might have led to a suspect.
From a fingerprint accidentally getting smudged, a shoe print getting walked over, or someone not connected to the crime at all walking through and having a loose hair fall at the scene, any time there are facts that impact the crime scene that could have otherwise been avoided by securing the scene, it's based on the failure of police officers.
According to the Center for Prosecutor Integrity, studies over the past 50 years, including some of those cited above, indicate that in 3,625 identified cases of prosecutorial misconduct, “public sanctions were imposed in only 63 cases – less than 2% of the time.” And of that discipline, just 14 prosecutors were suspended or disbarred.
The Center maintains a national registry of prosecutorial misconduct, available at prosecutorintegrity.org.
This was presetned for inclusion soley to bias the judge against the defendant in order to disrupt the normal sitting or use of  “tabula rasa” so the judge would  where judges intentionally set aside preconceptions and biases, creating a mental “blank slate” to fairly evaluate legal issues.
However, it is essential to recognize that taking this perspective to an extreme can lead to inaccurate and unfair decisions1.
Ensureing it is added to the "blank slate" that is employed by judges as they assume the repsponsiblities of hearing a case.
The concept of "tabula rasa," or blank slate, is crucial for judges who must approach each case without preconceptions to ensure a fair trial.
However, the scenario you describe, where a prosecutor attempts to influence a judge with inadmissible evidence, is an ethical violation and undermines this principle.
This practice can be particularly problematic as it capitalizes on cognitive biases that even experienced judges might find hard to completely disregard once exposed.
Several professional opinions and studies have addressed this issue: Legal Framework and Ethical Considerations: Ethically, attorneys are bound by the duty of candor to the tribunal, as outlined in rules like the Model Rules of Professional Conduct Rule 3.3, which obligates a lawyer not to offer evidence that they know to be false and generally requires rectifying any deception to the court.
Judges are similarly bound by judicial codes of conduct that require them to remain impartial and disregard inadmissible evidence.
Empirical Studies on Judicial Decision-Making: There have been studies suggesting that despite their training and ethical guidelines, judges are not immune to being influenced by inadmissible evidence.
For instance, a study might explore "anchoring effects," where initial impressions (such as those set by inadmissible evidence) disproportionately influence the final decision, even if such evidence is formally disregarded.
Legal Doctrines and Remedies: Legal doctrines such as the "doctrine of curative admissibility" and the use of "limiting instructions" are employed to mitigate the effects of improperly admitted evidence.
Research and case law may explore the effectiveness of these tools in actual judicial practice.
Case Studies and Legal Precedents: Reviewing historical cases where misconduct involving the presentation of inadmissible evidence was later uncovered can provide insights into both the short-term and long-term impacts of such actions on the justice process.
For instance, the infamous "pretrial publicity" cases often explore how external information (though not directly presented in court by prosecutors) influences jurors' and potentially judges' perceptions.
Similarly, misconduct by prosecutors, such as in the cases explored in "Prosecutorial Misconduct" by Joseph F. Lawless, often leads to discussions on how deeply such actions can undermine the integrity of the judicial process.
In constructing an argument against such unethical practices, one might employ the Toulmin Model: Claim: Introducing knowingly inadmissible evidence is unethical and undermines judicial impartiality.
Data: Empirical studies demonstrate that even judges can be influenced by initially presented inadmissible evidence due to cognitive biases.
Warrant: Ethical guidelines and legal standards require both judges and attorneys to disregard such evidence to maintain fairness and integrity in the legal process.
Backing: Codes of professional conduct and judicial decisions support the exclusion of such evidence and penalize its improper introduction.
Rebuttal: While some may argue that judges are trained to be immune to such influences, psychological studies and empirical evidence suggest otherwise.
Conclusion: To uphold justice, strict adherence to ethical standards regarding evidence admissibility must be enforced, and any violations should be met with appropriate sanctions.
Several states, including Texas, North Carolina, and Maryland, have adopted rules prohibiting improper “commitment” (or “stake-out” or “precommitment”) questions in juror voir dire, see, e.g., Standefer v. State, 59 S.W.3d 177, 183 (Tex.
146, 162 (2007); some other federal and state jurisdictions have addressed the issue in the context of “death-qualifying” juror voir dire in capital cases, see Morgan v. Illinois, 504 U.S. 719, 735-736 (1992); U.S. v. Tsarnaev, U.S. District Court No.
“An improper commitment question seeks to create a bias or prejudice in the panelists before they have heard the evidence.”  Rodriguez-Flores v. State, 351 S.W.3d 612, 621 (Tex.
This question asks the jurors whether they would resolve a person’s guilt based on his/her possession of a residue amount of cocaine in a crack pipe.
By contrast, the question, “If the alleged victim is a nun, could you be fair and impartial?,” is not an improper commitment question because it does not ask the panelist to resolve any issue in the case based on the fact that the victim is a nun, only to commit to what the law requires, i.e., being fair and impartial.
Not all case-specific questions are inappropriate, of course.
“The proper tests for whether a question is a ‘stake-out’ question are the following:  (1) Does the question ask a juror to speculate or precommit to how that juror might vote based on any particular facts?
or (2) Does it seek to discover in advance what a prospective juror’s decision will be under a certain state of the evidence?
or (3) Does it seek to cause prospective jurors to pledge themselves to a future course of action and indoctrinate them regarding potential issues before the evidence has been presented and they have been instructed on the law?”  U. S. v. Johnson, 366 F. Supp.2d 822, 845 (N.D. Iowa 2005).
I am concerned that trial judges and attorneys are not well informed about or skilled at asking questions during juror voir dire.
I strongly urge the courts and the bar to develop training programs on the topic of questioning prospective jurors.
By learning to keep our words out of the jurors’ mouths, we can achieve a more effective, trustworthy way of choosing a jury.
The act of Denial of a motion to continue is reviewed for abuse of discretion.
1  Removal  of  a  district  attorney  is  a  rare  occurrence  in  this  state; there is only one prior case where a district attorney was removed from office: In re Spivey, 345 N.C. 404, 480 S.E.2d 693 (1997).2 Spivey held that a proceeding under § 7A-66 is “an inquiry; it is neither a civil suit nor a criminal prosecution.” Id.
“A proceeding resulting in the removal of an individual from public office must accord that individual due process of law.” Id.
§ 7A-66 provides that “if a hearing, with or without suspension, is ordered, the district attorney should receive immediate written notice of the proceedings and a true copy of the charges, and the matter shall be set for hearing not less than 10 days nor more than 30 days thereafter.” N.C. Gen. Stat.
The trial court was therefore required by statute to hold the hearing between 9 February 2012 and 29 February 2012.
The trial court declined to remove or suspend the district attorney, and that ruling was upheld on appeal.
Taking  into  account  the  tight  time  frame  for  this  type  of proceeding prescribed by statute, and the accommodations that the trial judge  made  for  Cline  (postponing  the  hearing  from  13  February  2012 until 20 February 2012, restricting the scope of the hearing to statements made  by  Cline,  and  not  requiring  that  Cline  present  evidence  prior  to 24 February 2012) we cannot say that the trial court abused its discretion in denying Cline’s second motion for a continuance until March 2012.
We review the trial court’s admission of lay opinion testimony for abuse of discretion.
, , 716 S.E.2d 255, 259 (2011) conduct giving rise to this inquiry was conduct prejudicial to  the  administration  of  justice  which  brings  the  office into disrepute, is supported by the evidence and the other findings.
The statute itself compels removal upon a finding of one of the enumerated grounds and leaves no discretion in  this  regard  with  the  superior  court.
It is a hearing to determine the admissibility of evidence, or the competency of a witness or juror.
As the subject matter of the voir dire often relates to evidence, competence or other matters that may lead to bias on behalf of the jury, the jury may be removed from the court for the voir dire.
Case Analysis and Fact Gathering: Thoroughly review all available evidence, statements, and documents related to the case.
Exclusion of relevant evidence on grounds of prejudice, confusion, or waste of time.
– Evidence of a pertinent trait of his character offered by an accused, or by the prosecution to rebut the same; Rule 607. Who may impeach.
– If, while testifying, a witness uses a writing or object to refresh his memory, an adverse party is entitled to have the writing or object produced at the trial, hearing, or deposition in which the witness is testifying.
– If, before testifying, a witness uses a writing or object to refresh his memory for the purpose of testifying and the court in its discretion determines that the interests of justice so require, an adverse party is entitled to have those portions of any writing or of the object which relate to the testimony produced, if practicable, at the trial, hearing, or deposition in which the witness is testifying.
– A party entitled to have a writing or object produced under this rule is entitled to inspect it, to cross‑examine the witness thereon, and to introduce in evidence those portions which relate to the testimony of the witness.
If production of the writing or object at the trial, hearing, or deposition is impracticable, the court may order it made available for inspection.
If it is claimed that the writing or object contains privileged information or information not directly related to the subject matter of the testimony, the court shall examine the writing or object in camera, excise any such portions, and order delivery of the remainder to the party entitled thereto.
Any portion withheld over objections shall be preserved and made available to the appellate court in the event of an appeal.
If a writing or object is not produced, made available for inspection, or delivered pursuant to order under this rule, the court shall make any order justice requires, but in criminal cases if the prosecution elects not to comply, the order shall be one striking the testimony or, if justice so requires, declaring a mistrial.
Although relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.
To prove the content of a writing, recording, or photograph, the original writing, recording, or photograph is required, except as otherwise provided in these rules or by statute.
Admissibility of duplicates.
– An "original" of a writing or recording is the writing or recording itself or any counterpart intended to have the same effect by a person executing or issuing it.
August 14, 2009 "Defendant seeks to preclude plaintiff or plaintiff's counsel from referring to the incident upon which the action is based as a "rape" or a "sexual assault."
"However, in describing his current mental state or his response to the incident, plaintiff intends to use the word "rape."
"Plaintiff contends that the actual incident, during which an inmate touched his penis and buttocks while other inmates held him down, is accurately characterized as a "sexual assault."
The Court will not prohibit plaintiff from using the word "rape" as long as the word is not used in an effort to characterize the actual event, but instead is used only in connection with plaintiff's mental state or emotional response to the incident.
Similarly, the Court will not prohibit plaintiff from using the term "sexual assault."
The term "sexual assault," as defined by Ohio law, includes conduct that plaintiff claims occurred.
Defendant, of course, may propose a limiting instruction as to these terms."
Identify potential legal theories and defenses.
Formulate a trial strategy, including opening and closing arguments.
File and argue any necessary motions, such as motions to suppress evidence or limit the prosecution's case.
Pre-Trial Preparation: Develop a trial theme and theory.
Trial: Present the defense case.
Engage in jury selection, opening statements, direct and cross-examinations, and closing arguments.
Post-Trial: Address any post-trial motions or appeals.
Technology: Utilize legal software and tools for case management, evidence organization, and trial presentation.
This outline provides a starting point for a holistic defense strategy, but it should be tailored to the specifics of each case and jurisdiction.
2d  378  (19871, in  which  t h e   defendant  appealed the district  court's denial of  his  petition  for a writ of  habeas corpus, the court held that defendant committed  a procedural default in  failing  t o   pursue  his  ineffective  assistance  claim  in  his  first state  habeas  proceeding  and  was  therefore  barred  from  bringing his  habeas  claim  in  federal  court.
The  court  noted  in  its  holding that  defendant's  habeas  counsel asserted  during t h e  first  proceeding  that  he  was  not  making  an  ineffective  assistance  of  counsel claim  "and  thus had  not  effected  a  general waiver  of  t h e  attorney client  privilege."
340 N.C. 435 (1995)l right to present evidence in his defense, which right is guaranteed by the  Sixth Amendment.
Defendant  also  argues that  the  exclusion  of relevant evidence violates defendant's right to due process, which "is, in essence, the right to a fair opportunity to defend against the State's accusations."
Rule 10 functions as an important vehicle to insure that errors are not “built into” the record, thereby causing unnecessary appellate review.
2d 832 (1982), that a failure to except or object to errors at trial constitutes a waiver of the right to assert the alleged error on appeal.
2d 375 (1983), we considered the effect of our Rule 10(b)(2)when no objection or exception was made at trial to instructions to the jury, and adopted there the “plain error” rule.
2d 804 (1983), we adopted the plain error rule “with equal force” with regard to Rule 10(b)(1)when no objection or exception was made at trial to evidence presented and admitted, stating that: The rule that unless objection is made to the introduction of evidence at the time the evidence is offered, or unless there is a timely motion to strike the evidence, any objection thereto is deemed to have been waived is not simply a technical rule of procedure.
Were the rule otherwise, an undue if not impossible burden would be placed on the trial judge.
Since the party does not object a trial judge should not have to decide ‘on his own’ the soundness of a party’s trial strategy.
Reading the language of Rule 10(b)(1)that an exception may be properly preserved “by objection noted or which by rule or law was deemed preserved or taken without any such action,” together with the language of State v. Black, 308 N.C. 736, 303 S.E.
A party may not, after trial and judgment, comb through the transcript of the proceedings and randomly insert an exception notation in disregard of the mandates of Rule 10(b).
Where no action was taken by counsel during the course of the proceedings, the burden is on the party alleging error to establish its right to review; that is, that an exception, “by rule or law was deemed preserved or taken without any such action,” or that the alleged error constitutes plain error.
In so doing, a party must, prior to arguing the alleged error in his brief, (a) alert the appellate court that no action was taken by counsel at the trial level, and (b) establish his right to review by asserting in what manner the exception is preserved by rule or law or, when applicable, how the error amounted to a plain error or defect affecting a substantial right which may be noticed although not brought to the attention of the trial court.
We caution that our review will be carefully limited to those errors ‘in the exceptional case where, after reviewing the entire record, it can be said the claimed error is a “fundamental error, something so basic, so prejudicial, so lacking in its elements that justice cannot have been done,” or “where the error is grave error which amounts to a denial of a fun“ damental right of the accused,” or the error has ‘resulted in a miscarriage of justice or in the denial to appellant of a fair ” trial’ or where the error is such as to “seriously affect the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings” or where it can be fairly said “the instructional mistake had a probable impact on the jury’s finding that the ’ defendant was guilty.” State v. Odom, 307 N.C. at 660, 300 S.E.
Because the record in the case under consideration was filed prior to Odom and Black, and because the case involves sentences of death, we have elected to review all errors assigned, whether properly objected to at trial or alleged for the first time on this appeal.
They can't be introduced unlesseither I testify or someone else does.
Miranda Rights Law: Under Miranda v. Arizona (1966), suspects must be informed of their rights to remain silent and to an attorney when they are in custody and subject to interrogation.
Voluntariness of DNA Collection Law: The standard you cited indicates that a DNA sample should not be taken without a probable cause determination if the arrest is without a warrant.
Application: If the suspect was not formally arrested with a warrant or if no probable cause determination was made prior to the DNA collection, this could be a violation of the suspect's rights.
Right to Counsel Law: Suspects have the right to be informed of their right to counsel during nontestimonial identification procedures, and to have counsel present, especially if they cannot afford one.
Application: The suspect inquired about needing a lawyer, which should have been adequately addressed by informing them of their right to legal representation.
Detention and False Statements by Law Enforcement Law: Deceptive practices by police during interrogation can impact the admissibility of evidence and the voluntariness of statements and consent.
Application: The detective's misleading statement minimizing the seriousness of the matter could be considered deceptive and coercive, especially when the suspect was subsequently detained and interrogated.
Conflict of Interest Law: Ethical standards require law enforcement officers to disclose any potential conflicts of interest that could affect their handling of a case.
Procedural Requirements for Nontestimonial Identification Orders Law: Such orders require specific conditions to be met, including a sworn affidavit establishing probable cause and the material aid of the procedure to the investigation.
Application: If the nontestimonial identification procedures (such as the DNA sample) were conducted without adhering to these procedural requirements, it might be challenged as unlawful.
-----------------------------------------------I was not allowed to leave despite requesting to do so and was held without clear legal justification.
---------------------------------------------------------The  test  for  determining whether  pretrial  publicity  mandates  a change of  venue is whether  "it is reasonably  likely  that prospective jurors would base their decision in the case upon pretrial information rather  than  the  evidence presented  at trial  and would  be  unable  to remove  from  their  minds  any  preconceived  impressions  they  might have formed."
Defendant has the burden  of  proving the existence of  a reasonable likelihood that he cannot receive a fair trial in that county on account of prejudice from such pretrial publicity.
To meet this burden defendant must show that jurors have prior knowledge concerning the case, that he exhausted peremptory challenges and that a juror  objectionable to the defendant  sat on the jury.
In  deciding whether a defendant has met his burden o â‚¬  showing prejudice, it is relevant to consider that the  chosen jurors  stated that they  could ignore their prior  knowledge  or earlier formed opinions and decide the case solely on the evidence presented at trial.
The determination  of  whether a  defendant  has carried his burden of  showing that pretrial publicity precluded him from receiving a fair  trial  rests  within  the  trial  court's  sound  discretion.
IN  THE  SUPREME  COURT STATE v. KNIGHT 340 N.C.  531 (1995)l "Only  in  the  most  extraordinary  cases  can  an  appellate  court determine  solely  upon  evidence  adduced  prior  to  the  actual  commencement  of  jury  selection  that  a  trial  court  has  abused  its discretion by  denying  a motion  for change  of  venue  due to  existing prejudice  against  the  defendant."
After  reviewing  the information  submitted by  defendant in  support of  his pretrial motion for change of venue, we conclude that the trial  court  did  not err in  concluding that  defendant had  not made  a sufficient showing of  prejudice.
For example the lack of investigation has left people in the community that are tangentially involved in the case but are not listed in any documents due to the failure of a proper investigation.
The State has also essentially placed the burden of proof on the defendant to prove innocence.
The Defendant is entitled to an investigation as much as the prosecution.
In  opening  remarks,  counsel  are permitted  a  limited  preview  of the evidence and allowed to state the "legal claim or defense in basic terms."
Paige,  316  N.C.  at  648,  343  S.E.2d  at  859  (permissible  for counsel in opening statement to state that the defendant "would rely on  the  presumption  of  innocence.
DEFENSE COUNSEL: Objection.
A  defendant is entitled to a new trial on the basis of an improper question  if  there  is  a  reasonable  possibility  that  such  an  improper question  affected  the  outcome  of  his  trial.
Merely asking an improper question to which an objection is sustained does not automatically result in prejudice  to a  defendant.
When the trial court  sustains  a  defendant's  objections  to  improper  questions  and instructs the jury  to disregard such questions, any possible prejudice to  the  defendant  is  cured.
"Our courts have recognized  that there may be selectivity in prosecutions and that the exercise of  this prosecutorial prerogative  does not  reach  constitutional proportion  unless  there  be  a showing that the selection was deliberately based upon 'an unjustifiable standard such as race, religion or other arbitrary classification.'
In order for a motion to preserve evidence to be effective, however, it should be filed as soon as possible.
Defense counsel should consider the need for this motion when beginning to investigate the case as a part of discovery preparation.
Key Principles This motion puts the State on notice that it must retain and preserve evidence for independent testing or examination.
Therefore, consider making a motion to preserve when there is a risk that the State may destroy or fail to preserve evidence necessary for the defense—for example, 911 tapes, digital surveillance, forensics, or other physical evidence that is at risk of decay or destruction due to retention policies, testing, passage of time, or any other reason.
In addition to ensuring complete access by the defense to evidence that otherwise may be lost or destroyed, filing this motion can assist in establishing a statutory or constitutional violation for the loss or destruction of evidence.
Practice Tips  A notice to preserve evidence should be tailored to a specific concern about particular evidence in the case.
The notice should identify the evidence that is of concern, specify the importance of that evidence to the defense, and specify the nature and extent of the concern of loss or destruction of the evidence.
For instance, jails and 911 call centers often have internal policies regarding retention of audio or video recordings, and labs often have policies regarding testing of small samples of materials that are likely to be destroyed in testing.
Where possible, obtain and attach to the motion any policies of the entity with possession of the evidence that document the risk of loss or destruction of the evidence.
1, § 4.6C (Other Constitutional Rights—Lost or Destroyed Evidence).
F. Motion for Deposition Authority G.S.
Key Principles While rare in criminal cases, this statute allows for the use of depositions by the defense in limited circumstances.
Where a material witness is ill, physically unable to attend trial, or resides in another state, the defendant may seek an order from the clerk of superior court of the jurisdiction where the criminal case is pending to take the deposition of the witness by filing an affidavit and request with the clerk.
The affidavit filed with the clerk must (1) include a statement that the testimony of the person sought to be deposed is important to the defense; (2) provide the witness’s name; and (3) state that the witness is physically ill, incapacitated, or is not a resident of North Carolina and that the witness cannot attend the trial.
By statute, the clerk is directed to appoint a person to take the deposition.
Counsel may consider informing the trial judge ahead of time of the intent to seek this request from the clerk.
This provision about criminal depositions applies to the defendant only; the State has no statutory right to obtain a deposition in a criminal case.
If a deposition is obtained, the statute states that the testimony from the deposition may be read at trial in the same manner that depositions may be used at civil trials, per Rule 32 of the N.C. Rules of Civil Procedure motions for change of venue under G.S.
Motion for a special venire The arresting law enforcement officer shall obtain or cause to be obtained a DNA sample from an arrested person at the time of arrest or when fingerprinted However if the person is arrested without a warrant then the DNA sample shall not be taken until a probable cause determination has been made pursuant to GS  A-(.

Issuance of order Upon a showing that the grounds specified in GS A exist the judge may issue an order requiring the person named or described with reasonable certainty in the affidavit to appear at a designated time  place  to submit to designated nontestimonial identification procedures Unless the nature of the evidence sought makes it likely that delay will adversely affect its probative value or when it appears likely that the person named in the order may destroy alter or modify the evidence sought or may not appear the order must be served at least hours before the time designated for the nontestimonial identification procedure procedures  in no event for longer than six hours unless he is arrested for an offense ( Any such person is entitled to have counsel present  must be advised prior to being subjected to any nontestimonial identification procedures of his right to have counsel present during any nontestimonial identification procedure  to the appointment of counsel if he cannot afford to retain counsel Appointment of counsel shall be in accordance with rules adopted by the Office of Indigent Defense Services No statement made during nontestimonial identification procedures by the subject of the procedures shall be admissible in any criminal proceeding against him unless his counsel was present at the time the statement was made ( Any person who resists compliance with the authorized nontestimonial identification procedures may be held in contempt of the court which issued the order pursuant to the provisions of GS A-(  GS A-(.

power
and effectiveness of a closing argument is a vital part of the adversarial
process
that forms the basis of our justice system.
A wellreasoned, wellarticulated
closing
argument can be a critical part of winning a case.
However, such argument, no
matter
how effective, must (I) be devoid of counsel's personal opinion;
(2) avoid namecalling andor references to matters beyond the record;
(3) be premised on logical deductions, not on appeals to passion or prejudice;
and
(4) be constructed from fair inferences drawn only from evidence properly
admitted
at trial.
Moreover, professional decorum requires that tactics such as
namecalling
and showmanship must defer to a higher standard.
There are many situations in which a district attorney may deem it advisable to
initiate
criminal proceedings by indictment, e.g., where there is no fear of flight by a
defendant,
or where there exists a need for confidentiality to avoid needless harm to the
reputation
of a prospective accused.
In such instances, a prosecutor may elect to eschew
the
needless waste of judicial and prosecutorial resources which an unnecessary
probable
cause hearing would engender.
Since the availability of this discretion to a
district
attorney bears a rational relationship to a legitimate governmental objective,
i.e.,
the more efficient administration of criminal justice, it is not subject to

challenge.

Criminal Law § 34.4— evidence of other
offenses committed
by defendant— admissibility to show intent, motive, common scheme or plan 7.
Criminal
Law § 102.5— prosecutor’s conduct in examining witness Every criminal
defendant is
entitled to have a fair trial which is conducted before an impartial judge and
unprejudiced
jury in an atmosphere of calm deliberation.
2d 561 (1971).The obligation to take steps to assure a
defendant’s
right to a fair trial rests upon the shoulders of both the presiding judge and
the
district attorney.
2d 762 (1954).However, it
should
be noted that the obligation of the district attorney to conduct himself in
such
a manner as to assure the right to a fair trial does in no way lessen his
obligation
to the state to prosecute criminal charges to the best of his abilities on the
basis
of the evidence that he is able to bring before the jury.
Accordingly,
counsel is given wide latitude in the argument of hotly contested trials,
subject
to the exercise of the sound discretion of the presiding judge.
The district attorney has the right and the duty to crossexamine vigorously a
defendant
who takes the stand in his own defense, State v. Ross, 275 N.C. 550, 169 S.E.
The district attorney’s performance of his duties as public prosecutor is
tempered
by his obligation to the defendant to assure that he is afforded his right to a
fair
trial.
Therefore, he may not, by argument or by crossexamination, place before
the
jury incompetent and prejudicial matters.
This rule is
violated
by asking questions which are phrased impertinently or insultingly so as to
badger
or humiliate a witness.
2d 604 (1965).The
test
that is to be applied is whether the evidence tends to shed any light upon the
subject
matter of the inquiry or has as its only effect the exciting of prejudice or
sympathy.
Police or Prosecutor
Misconduct
Is at Root of Half of Exoneration Cases, Study Finds Official misconduct played
a
role in the criminal convictions of more than half of innocent people who were
later
exonerated, according to a new report by a registry that tracks wrongful
convictions.
“Official misconduct damages truthseeking by our
criminal
justice system and undermines public confidence,” Samuel Gross, a professor
emeritus
of law at the University of Michigan and the report’s lead author, said in a
statement
on Tuesday.
“The great majority of
wrongful
convictions are never discovered, so the scope of the problem is much greater
than
these numbers show.” The study, which is based on 2,400 exonerations recorded
in
the registry from 1989 until early 2019, found that prosecutors and police
officers
committed misconduct at comparable rates (30 percent and 34 percent).
In
federal
cases, however, prosecutors “committed misconduct more than twice as often as
police,”
especially in federal whitecollar cases in which they “committed misconduct
seven
times as often as police,” according to the report.
The report details the
different
types of misconduct that can occur at different stages of a case.
Nearly all of
the
official misconduct identified falls into five general categories witness
tampering,
misconduct in interrogations, fabricating evidence, concealing exculpatory
evidence
and misconduct at trial.
“As few police officers as there are who are arrested
and
convicted of official misconduct, there are almost no prosecutors” who face
such
consequences, Mr. Feinman said, adding, “I’ve never heard of any prosecutor
being
arrested for misconduct, and almost no prosecutors are fired or disbarred for
misconduct.”
Jeffrey Bellin, a professor at William & Mary Law School in Williamsburg, Va.,
and
a former prosecutor, called the trial of an innocent person “the most
important test
of our criminal justice system.” He said it was not surprising that “when
the system
fails that test by convicting someone who is innocent, police and prosecutors
are
often implicated in that failure.” “At the same time, this is a part of the
problem
that can most easily be fixed,” Professor Bellin said.
“Prosecutors need to see
themselves
as part of a system that does justice, not as unilaterally responsible for
convicting
those who they perceive to be guilty.” Speedy trial The prosecutorial
indifference
and the judicial intemperance manifested in this colloquy is neither condoned
nor
approved.
Defendant again maintains that the district attorney improperly
injected
facts outside the record inapposite The cases principally relied upon by
defendant
are clearly inapposite, and the reasoning of those cases simply cannot be
stretched
to encompass the imaginative and innovative standard of double jeopardy which
defendant
seeks to impose request for change of venue request sanctions against DA
Where the United States Supreme Court has said the federal constitution does
not
prohibit the use of absolute prosecutorial discretion in determining which
cases
to prosecute for first degree murder so long as such discretionary decisions
are
not based on race, religion, or some other impermissible classification, the
North
Carolina Supreme Court is not inclined to interpret our state constitution to
require
more.
Therefore, defendant’s argument that our death penalty statute violates
the
equal protection of the laws clause of the Fourteenth Amendment because it
afforded
the district attorney “unbridled” discretion in deciding against whom he
will seek
verdicts of first degree murder and the death penalty must fail where defendant
failed
to show that the district attorney based his decision to seek the death penalty
in
defendant’s case upon unjustifiable standards like “race, religion or other
arbitrary
classification.” Id.
denied, 446 U.S. 941 (1980), the
defendant
claimed our death penalty procedure denied defendants constitutional due
process
because it placed no limits on the case calendaring prerogatives of the
district
attorney, who could, according to defendant, “calendar cases when he chooses,
in
front of whatever judge he chooses.” In rejecting this argument, we said Our
courts
have recognized that there may be selectivity in prosecutions and that the
exercise
of this prosecutorial prerogative does not reach constitutional proportion
unless
there be a showing that the selection was deliberately based upon ‘an
unjustifiable
standard such as race, religion or other arbitrary classification.’ Citations,
including
Oyler, omitted.
The United States Supreme Court
has
rejected arguments identical to defendant’s in the context of death penalty
procedures.
Defendant fails to show that the district attorney based his decision to seek
the
death penalty in defendant’s or any other death case upon unjustifiable
standards
like “race, religion or other arbitrary classification.” The United States
Supreme
Court says the federal constitution does not prohibit the use of absolute
prosecutorial
discretion in determining which cases to prosecute for first degree murder so
long
as such discretionary decisions are not based on race, religion, or some other
impermissible
classification.
We are not inclined to interpret our state constitution to
require
more.2 The Court then stated that “the due process inquiry must consider the
reasons
for the delay as well as the prejudice to the accused.” Id.
In determining whether the defendant in the present case is entitled to
dismissal
of the charges against him for violation of his constitutional due process
right
to a speedy trial, we must first consider the reasons for the preindictment
delay.
It is clear, however, that the State’s decision to
postpone
indictment until 1981 was sound.
In Lovasco, the United
States
Supreme Court wrote “In our view, investigative delay is fundamentally unlike
delay
undertaken by the Government solely ‘to gain tactical advantage over the
accused’
.” Id.
In a preLovasco case, this Court
recognized the
legitimacy of preindictment investigative delay, stating that “the legitimate
need
to protect the existence of an ongoing undercover investigation from exposure
has
been frequently recognized by the federal courts as a reasonable justification
for
delay in bringing an indictment.” State v. Dietz, 289 N.C. 488, 492, 223 S.E.
Comment The responsibility of a public prosecutor, which for
these
purposes includes a government lawyer having a prosecutorial role, differs from
that
of the usual advocate; his duty is to seek justice, not merely to convict.
This special duty exists because
(1) the prosecutor represents the sovereign and therefore should use restraint
in
the discretionary exercise of government powers, such as in the selection of
cases
to prosecute;
(2) during trial the prosecutor is not only an advocate but he also may make
decisions
normally made by an individual client, and those affecting the public interest
should
be fair to all; and
(3) in our system of criminal justice the accused is to be given the benefit of
all
reasonable doubts.
With respect to evidence and witnesses, the prosecutor has
responsibilities
different from those of a lawyer in private practice; the prosecutor should
make
timely disclosure to the defense of available evidence, known to him, that
tends
to negate the guilt of the accused, mitigate the degree of the offense, or
reduce
the punishment.
Further, a prosecutor should not intentionally avoid pursuit of
evidence
merely because he believes it will damage the prosecutor’s case or aid the
accused.
The exception in paragraph (D) recognizes that a prosecutor may seek an
appropriate
protective order from the tribunal if disclosure of information to the defense
could
result in substantial harm to an individual or to the public interest.
RULE 7.2 Representing the Client Within the Bounds of the Law
(A) In his representation of a client, a lawyer shall not
(1) File a suit, assert a position, conduct a defense, controvert an issue,
delay
a trial, or take other action on behalf of his client when he knows or when it
is
obvious that such action would be frivolous or would serve merely to harass or
maliciously
injure another.
(2) Knowingly advance a claim or defense that is unwarranted under existing
law,
except that he may advance such claim or defense if it can be supported by good
faith
argument for an extension, modification, or reversal of existing law.
A lawyer
for
the defendant in a criminal proceeding, or the respondent in a proceeding that
could
result in incarceration, may nevertheless so defend as to require that every
element
of the case against his client be established.
(3) Conceal or knowingly fail to disclose that which he is required by law to
reveal.
(4)) Knowingly make a false statement of law or fact.
(5) Knowingly use perjured testimony or false evidence.
(7) Unlawfully obstruct another party’s access to evidence or unlawfully
alter, destroy
or conceal a document or other material having potential evidentiary value.
(8) Counsel or assist his client in conduct that the lawyer knows to be illegal
or
fraudulent.
(9) Knowingly engage in other illegal conduct or conduct contrary
to
a Disciplinary Rule.
(B) A lawyer who receives information clearly establishing that
(1) His client intends to or has, in the course of the representation,
perpetrated
a fraud upon a person or tribunal shall promptly call upon his client to
rectify
the same, and, if the client refuses or is unable to do so, he shall
discontinue
his representation of the client in that matter; and if the representation
involves
litigation, the lawyer shall (if applicable rules require) request the tribunal
to
permit him to withdraw, but without necessarily revealing his reason for
wishing
to withdraw.
(2) A person other than his client has perpetrated a fraud upon a tribunal
shall
promptly reveal the fraud to the tribunal.
The advocate’s task is to present
the
client’s case with persuasive force.
Performance of that duty while
maintaining confidences
of the client is qualified by the advocate’s duty of candor to the tribunal.
However,
an advocate does not vouch for the evidence submitted in a cause; the tribunal
is
responsible for assessing its probative value.
An advocate is responsible for
pleadings
and other documents prepared for litigation, but is usually not required to
have
personal knowledge of matters asserted therein, for litigation documents
ordinarily
present assertions by the client, or by someone on the client’s behalf, and
not assertions
by the lawyer.
However, an assertion purporting to be of the lawyer’s own
knowledge,
as in an affidavit by the lawyer or in a statement in open court, may properly
be
made only when the lawyer knows the assertion is true or believes it to be true
on
the basis of a reasonably diligent inquiry.
The obligation prescribed in Rule 7.1(A)(4)not to counsel a client to commit or
assist
the client in committing a fraud applies in litigation.
If the false evidence is
introduced
before the lawyer discovers its falsity, the lawyer shall reveal the fraud to
the
tribunal.
When false evidence is offered by the client, however, a conflict may
arise
between the lawyer’s duty to keep the client’s revelations confidential and
the duty
of candor to the court.
If the persuasion is ineffective, the lawyer must seek to withdraw.
The
prosecutor
in a criminal or quasicriminal case shall
(A) Refrain from prosecuting a charge that he knows is not supported by
probable
cause, unless otherwise directed by statutory mandate;
(B) Make reasonable efforts to assure that the accused has been advised of the
right
to, and the procedure for obtaining, counsel and has been given reasonable
opportunity
to obtain counsel;
(C) Not seek to obtain from an unrepresented accused a waiver of important
pretrial
rights, such as the right to a preliminary hearing;
(D) Make timely disclosure to the defense of all evidence or information known
to
him that tends to negate the guilt of the accused or mitigates the offense,
and,
in connection with sentencing, disclose to the defense and to the tribunal all
unprivileged
mitigating information known to him, except when he is relieved of this
responsibility
by a protective order of the tribunal; and
(E) Exercise reasonable care to prevent investigators, law enforcement
personnel,
employees, or other persons assisting or associated with him from making an
extrajudicial
statement that he would be prohibited from making under Rule 7.7.

Prosecutorial Misconduct Cases And Examples June 4, 2020 By Samuel Partida, Jr.
What
is prosecutorial misconduct?
If you ask most criminal defendants they’d tell
you
if you want to see an an example of prosecutorial misconduct all you have to do
is
look at his case.
The law, in fact, gives prosecutors wide latitude to operate
and
it takes pretty obvious and egregious conduct before a court will finds that
prosecutorial
misconduct has occurred.
Prosecutorial Misconduct A prejudicial denial of due
process
can occur where an indictment is procured through prosecutorial misconduct.
“The due process rights of a defendant may be
violated
if the prosecutor deliberately or intentionally misleads the grand jury, uses
known
perjured or false testimony, or presents other deceptive or inaccurate
evidence.”
Oliver, 368 Ill. App.
Therefore, prosecutorial misconduct is a general description of wrong
doing
by a prosecutorial, but a defendant has to point to some prejudice before he
can
ask for a dismissal or a suppression of evidence.
To warrant dismissal of the
indictment,
the denial of due process must be unequivocally clear, and the prejudice must
be
actual and substantial.
Prosecutorial
misconduct
resulting in a due process violation is actually and substantially prejudicial
only
if the grand jury would not have otherwise indicted the defendant.
In a grand jury room prejudice is shown if the evidence was
so
weak that the misconduct induced the grand jury to indict.
3d at 69798. n law, sua sponte (Latin "of his, her, its or their own accord")
or
suo motu ("on its own motion") describes an act of authority taken without
formal
prompting from another party.
The term is usually applied to actions by a judge
taken
without a prior motion or request from the parties.
suborned perjury 1We
acknowledge
the principle discussed in the special concurrence–credibility determinations
are
to be made by the trier of fact.
Again, because we are at first stage, we accept the affidavit as
true.
In reviewing a postconviction petition, it is the
role
of the trial court to act as the trier of fact, making credibility
determinations,
deciding the weight to give testimony and evidence, and resolving evidentiary
conflicts.
Hammond’s affidavit is sufficient to survive first stage due to the
fact it
contains an allegation that he was under instruction, inferentially by a
prosecuting
entity, to omit certain highly relevant facts.
at the second stage if the judge ruling on the postconviction
petition
presided over the defendant’s trial, or at the third stage if someone other
than
the trial judge rules on the petition.
3d at
40.25While
I agree with the majority that defendant’s postconviction petition is
sufficient
to survive the first stage of postconviction proceedings, I disagree with the
majority’s
characterization of Hammond’s testimony as “unreliable.” The reliability
or unreliability
of Hammond’s testimony is to be determined by the trial court, acting as the
trier
of fact, at the second or third stage of postconviction proceedings.
Failing to correct
trial
testimony known to be perjured by a government witness.
Finally, the
analysis
in the investigation’s report should include a fair observation of the
investigator’s
performance—how he or she handled and analyzed evidence and intelligence—and
consider
how that performance affected, both positively and negatively, the
investigation’s
conclusions.
As an investigator, however,
it
can lead to disastrous results.
In simple terms, confirmation bias occurs when
you
develop a hypothesis and then view the evidence in a light that helps confirm
that
hypothesis.
The job of an investigator, however, is to gather and
evaluate
all evidence from which an objective conclusion can be reached.
Witness tampering
When it comes to most criminal investigations, police officers owe a duty to
the
public at large, not to any particular individuals.
If police do investigate, they still have no duty to follow up on
every
lead or expend every resource in a criminal investigation.
Because no duty of
care
is owed to a particular victim, victims generally don't have any legal recourse
in
court, even when police were negligent in their investigation or in failing to
investigate
(absent extraordinary circumstances discussed below).
File a Complaint With Internal Affairs, Police Disciplinary
Board,
or a Governing Body An aggrieved victim or witness who believes police engaged
in
misconduct or were negligent in their investigation may file a complaint with
one
or more of the following the internal affairs department for the law
enforcement
agency a state or local police disciplinary board a state or local citizen
oversight
board, or the U.S. Department of Justice or a state human rights department (to
report
civil rights violations).
A victim could also file a complaint with the local
or
state governing body that oversees and funds the law enforcement agency.
For
instance,
a person could raise issues relating to a police department with the city
council.
Remedies Available Through Complaints on Police Officers The available remedies
will
usually depend on the authority granted to these agencies or departments.
It's
possible
a complaint could start the wheels of justice and push the police to conduct or
reopen
an investigation.
The complaint might also lead to an investigation of the
police
officer's conduct or department policies and procedures.
If an oversight board or agency determines an officer was
negligent
or engaged in misconduct or unethical behavior, it might issue one or more of
the
following disciplinary actions oral or written remand suspension with or
without
pay demotion mandatory training decertification (take away their officer
licensing
or certification), or termination.
In egregious cases, an
officer
could be charged with a criminal offense, such as misconduct of a public
officer,
harassment, illegally concealing or tampering with evidence, or making threats.
Civil
Rights Violations and Discrimination If an officer's failure to investigate a
crime
takes the form of discrimination, a person may have a civil rights action
against
the officer or the department.
For instance, if police routinely fail to
investigate
domestic violence reports made by Black women, a victim might be able to prove
this
inaction amounts to racial and gender discrimination—a violation of equal
protection
under the law.
Another example would be the failure of police to investigate
suspected
murders of missing Indigenous women.
In these types of cases, a person could
file
a federal or state civil rights action.
These lawsuits can be difficult to win
but
monetary damages are possible if successful.
In cases where a police agency, as
a
whole, engages in discriminatory investigative practice, the attorney general
can
sue the agency and ask the court to order the agency to change its practices
(usually
through a plan overseen by a court and the Justice Department).
Police may also
be
subject to criminal prosecution and penalties for depriving a person of their
constitutional
rights.
CAUSES
OF POLICE OFFICER INADEQUACY IN INVESTIGATIONS The term "failure to investigate
properly"
covers several issues related to the police force's inadequate handling of a
case.
This can include any of the following Failure to secure a crime scene.
Failure
to maintain the appropriate chain of custody.
The unlawful searching of you or
your
property.
Failure to serve a suspect their Miranda rights upon arrest.
The use
of
excessive force.
Sexual assault or sexual coercion by a law enforcement
officer.
Other certain circumstances where your rights are violated.
A situation where
you
were discriminated against by police.
One of our country's basic constitutional
rights
is that a person cannot be arrested and charged with a crime without being
served
Miranda warnings.
Miranda rights are when, upon a suspect's arrest, the
arresting
officer explains to the suspect that he or she has the fifth Amendment right
not
to make incriminating statements about themself.
The Miranda rights that must
be
given upon a suspect's arrest are The right to remain silent.
The warning that
any
statement they make can be used against them in a court of law.
The right to an
attorneyand
this right includes a courtappointed public defender if they cannot afford to
secure
their own private legal counsel.
In addition to Miranda warnings, the police
must
adhere to ethical guidelines like having probable cause when searching a
suspect
or their property as well as either consent to search or a search warrant that
gives
them the legal right to search.
For example, if you are charged with the intent
to
sell drugs, but the search of your vehicle where they found the drugs was
searched
without probable cause, consent, or a search warrantthen you may have a case
against
the arresting officer.
Failing To Maintain The Chain Of Custody When evidence
is
collected at a crime scene, it's vital that the police officers at the scene
follow
the proper chain of custody for evidence.
What this means is that there are
specific
guidelines on how to handle, document, and store evidence from the scene of a
crime.
If throughout a criminal investigation, a police officer fails to maintain the
preestablished
chain of custody, they have failed to properly investigate the crime.
Examples
of
errors in maintaining the chain of custody are Not securing evidence properly,
for
instance not tagging or bagging it.
Not restricting who handles
or
sees the evidence.
When there is a failure to maintain the chain of custody, a
judge
may rule that the evidence cannot be brought before the court.
This means that
valuable
evidence that could secure a conviction would not be allowed to be referenced
in
court due to the mistake of the officer.
Failing To Properly Collect Evidence
Failing
to collect evidence from the scene that may pertain to the investigation can
make
a huge impact on any investigation.
The type of evidence that can be collected
at
a crime scene are Fingerprints Footprints Hair Nails Blood Other cell tissue
from
a victim or perpetrator Weapons Residue from guns Fire accelerants Drugs or
alcohol
If any evidence is missed or if the evidence is not handled with care, it can
lead
to the arrest of the wrong person or result in no arrest at all for a crime
committed
against you.
Failing To Secure The Crime Scene After police are called to the
scene
of a crime, it is the responsibility of the very first officer on the scene to
secure
the crime scene.
What this means is that as soon as law enforcement arrives at
the
scene, they must establish a marked barrier to limit anyone other than
investigators
from interacting with the crime scene.
If anyone tampers with evidence or there
is
DNA left behind from individuals present at the crime scene due to the first
officer
on the scene failing to secure the scene, it can lead to lifechanging false
imprisonments
or the failure to collect evidence that might have led to a suspect.
From a
fingerprint
accidentally getting smudged, a shoe print getting walked over, or someone not
connected
to the crime at all walking through and having a loose hair fall at the scene,
any
time there are facts that impact the crime scene that could have otherwise been
avoided
by securing the scene, it's based on the failure of police officers.
According
to
the Center for Prosecutor Integrity, studies over the past 50 years, including
some
of those cited above, indicate that in 3,625 identified cases of prosecutorial
misconduct,
“public sanctions were imposed in only 63 cases – less than 2% of the
time.” And
of that discipline, just 14 prosecutors were suspended or disbarred.
The Center
maintains
a national registry of prosecutorial misconduct, available at
prosecutorintegrity.org.
This was presetned
for
inclusion soley to bias the judge against the defendant in order to disrupt the
normal
sitting or use of “tabula rasa” so the judge would where judges
intentionally set
aside preconceptions and biases, creating a mental “blank slate” to fairly
evaluate
legal issues.
However, it is essential to recognize that taking this
perspective
to an extreme can lead to inaccurate and unfair decisions1.
Ensureing it is
added
to the "blank slate" that is employed by judges as they assume the
repsponsiblities
of hearing a case.
The concept of "tabula rasa," or blank slate, is crucial
for
judges who must approach each case without preconceptions to ensure a fair
trial.
However, the scenario you describe, where a prosecutor attempts to influence a
judge
with inadmissible evidence, is an ethical violation and undermines this
principle.
This practice can be particularly problematic as it capitalizes on cognitive
biases
that even experienced judges might find hard to completely disregard once
exposed.
Several professional opinions and studies have addressed this issue Legal
Framework
and Ethical Considerations Ethically, attorneys are bound by the duty of candor
to
the tribunal, as outlined in rules like the Model Rules of Professional Conduct
Rule
3.3, which obligates a lawyer not to offer evidence that they know to be false
and
generally requires rectifying any deception to the court.
Judges are similarly
bound
by judicial codes of conduct that require them to remain impartial and
disregard
inadmissible evidence.
Empirical Studies on Judicial DecisionMaking There have
been
studies suggesting that despite their training and ethical guidelines, judges
are
not immune to being influenced by inadmissible evidence.
For instance, a study
might
explore "anchoring effects," where initial impressions (such as those set by
inadmissible
evidence) disproportionately influence the final decision, even if such
evidence
is formally disregarded.
Legal Doctrines and Remedies Legal doctrines such as the "doctrine of curative
admissibility"
and the use of "limiting instructions" are employed to mitigate the effects of
improperly
admitted evidence.
Research and case law may explore the effectiveness of these
tools
in actual judicial practice.
Case Studies and Legal Precedents Reviewing
historical
cases where misconduct involving the presentation of inadmissible evidence was
later
uncovered can provide insights into both the shortterm and longterm impacts of
such
actions on the justice process.
For instance, the infamous "pretrial publicity"
cases
often explore how external information (though not directly presented in court
by
prosecutors) influences jurors' and potentially judges' perceptions.
Similarly,
misconduct
by prosecutors, such as in the cases explored in "Prosecutorial Misconduct" by
Joseph
F. Lawless, often leads to discussions on how deeply such actions can undermine
the
integrity of the judicial process.
In constructing an argument against such
unethical
practices, one might employ the Toulmin Model Claim Introducing knowingly
inadmissible
evidence is unethical and undermines judicial impartiality.
Data Empirical
studies
demonstrate that even judges can be influenced by initially presented
inadmissible
evidence due to cognitive biases.
Warrant Ethical guidelines and legal
standards
require both judges and attorneys to disregard such evidence to maintain
fairness
and integrity in the legal process.
Backing Codes of professional conduct and
judicial
decisions support the exclusion of such evidence and penalize its improper
introduction.
Rebuttal While some may argue that judges are trained to be immune to such
influences,
psychological studies and empirical evidence suggest otherwise.
Conclusion To
uphold
justice, strict adherence to ethical standards regarding evidence admissibility
must
be enforced, and any violations should be met with appropriate sanctions.
Several
states, including Texas, North Carolina, and Maryland, have adopted rules
prohibiting
improper “commitment” (or “stakeout” or “precommitment”) questions
in juror voir
dire, see, e.g., Standefer v. State, 59 S.W.3d 177, 183 (Tex.
146, 162 (2007); some other
federal
and state jurisdictions have addressed the issue in the context of
“deathqualifying”
juror voir dire in capital cases, see Morgan v. Illinois, 504 U.S. 719, 735736
(1992);
U.S. v. Tsarnaev, U.S. District Court No.
“An improper commitment question seeks to create a bias or
prejudice
in the panelists before they have heard the evidence.” RodriguezFlores v.
State,
351 S.W.3d 612, 621 (Tex.
This question asks the jurors
whether
they would resolve a person’s guilt based on hisher possession of a residue
amount
of cocaine in a crack pipe.
By contrast, the question, “If the alleged
victim
is a nun, could you be fair and impartial?,” is not an improper commitment
question
because it does not ask the panelist to resolve any issue in the case based on
the
fact that the victim is a nun, only to commit to what the law requires, i.e.,
being
fair and impartial.
“The proper tests for whether a question is a ‘stakeout’
question are
the following (1) Does the question ask a juror to speculate or precommit to
how
that juror might vote based on any particular facts?
or (2) Does it seek to
discover
in advance what a prospective juror’s decision will be under a certain state
of the
evidence?
or (3) Does it seek to cause prospective jurors to pledge themselves
to
a future course of action and indoctrinate them regarding potential issues
before
the evidence has been presented and they have been instructed on the law?” U.
S.
v. Johnson, 366 F. Supp.2d 822, 845 (N.D. Iowa 2005).
I am concerned that trial
judges
and attorneys are not well informed about or skilled at asking questions during
juror
voir dire.
I strongly urge the courts and the bar to develop training programs
on
the topic of questioning prospective jurors.
By learning to keep our words out
of
the jurors’ mouths, we can achieve a more effective, trustworthy way of
choosing
a jury.

1 Removal of a district
attorney
is a rare occurrence in this state; there is only one prior case where a
district
attorney was removed from office In re Spivey, 345 N.C. 404, 480 S.E.2d 693
(1997).2
Spivey held that a proceeding under § 7A66 is “an inquiry; it is neither a
civil
suit nor a criminal prosecution.” Id.
“A
proceeding resulting
in the removal of an individual from public office must accord that individual
due
process of law.” Id.
§ 7A66
provides that
“if a hearing, with or without suspension, is ordered, the district attorney
should
receive immediate written notice of the proceedings and a true copy of the
charges,
and the matter shall be set for hearing not less than 10 days nor more than 30
days
thereafter.” N.C. Gen. Stat.
The trial court was therefore required by statute to hold the hearing between 9
February
2012 and 29 February 2012.
The trial court
declined
to remove or suspend the district attorney, and that ruling was upheld on
appeal.
Taking into account the tight time frame for this type of proceeding prescribed
by
statute, and the accommodations that the trial judge made for Cline (postponing
the
hearing from 13 February 2012 until 20 February 2012, restricting the scope of
the
hearing to statements made by Cline, and not requiring that Cline present
evidence
prior to 24 February 2012) we cannot say that the trial court abused its
discretion
in denying Cline’s second motion for a continuance until March 2012.
We review
the
trial court’s admission of lay opinion testimony for abuse of discretion.
, , 716 S.E.2d 255, 259 (2011) conduct giving
rise
to this inquiry was conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice which
brings
the office into disrepute, is supported by the evidence and the other findings.
The
statute itself compels removal upon a finding of one of the enumerated grounds
and
leaves no discretion in this regard with the superior court.
It is a hearing to determine the admissibility of evidence, or
the
competency of a witness or juror.
As the subject matter of the voir dire often
relates
to evidence, competence or other matters that may lead to bias on behalf of the
jury,
the jury may be removed from the court for the voir dire.

– If, while testifying, a witness uses a writing or
object
to refresh his memory, an adverse party is entitled to have the writing or
object
produced at the trial, hearing, or deposition in which the witness is
testifying.
– If, before testifying, a witness uses a writing or
object
to refresh his memory for the purpose of testifying and the court in its
discretion
determines that the interests of justice so require, an adverse party is
entitled
to have those portions of any writing or of the object which relate to the
testimony
produced, if practicable, at the trial, hearing, or deposition in which the
witness
is testifying.
– A party entitled to have a
writing
or object produced under this rule is entitled to inspect it, to cross‑examine
the
witness thereon, and to introduce in evidence those portions which relate to
the
testimony of the witness.
If production of the writing or object at the trial,
hearing,
or deposition is impracticable, the court may order it made available for
inspection.
If it is claimed that the writing or object contains privileged information or
information
not directly related to the subject matter of the testimony, the court shall
examine
the writing or object in camera, excise any such portions, and order delivery
of
the remainder to the party entitled thereto.
Any portion withheld over
objections
shall be preserved and made available to the appellate court in the event of an
appeal.
If a writing or object is not produced, made available for inspection, or
delivered
pursuant to order under this rule, the court shall make any order justice
requires,
but in criminal cases if the prosecution elects not to comply, the order shall
be
one striking the testimony or, if justice so requires, declaring a mistrial.
Although relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative value is
substantially
outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or
misleading
the jury, or by considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless
presentation
of cumulative evidence.

PreTrial Preparation Develop a trial theme and theory.
Trial Present the defense case.
Engage in
jury
selection, opening statements, direct and crossexaminations, and closing
arguments.
Technology Utilize legal software
and
tools for case management, evidence organization, and trial presentation.
This outline provides a starting point for a holistic defense strategy, but it
should
be tailored to the specifics of each case and jurisdiction.
2d 378 (19871, in
which
t h e defendant appealed the district court's denial of his petition for a writ
of
habeas corpus, the court held that defendant committed a procedural default in
failing
t o pursue his ineffective assistance claim in his first state habeas
proceeding
and was therefore barred from bringing his habeas claim in federal court.
The
court
noted in its holding that defendant's habeas counsel asserted during t h e
first
proceeding that he was not making an ineffective assistance of counsel claim
"and
thus had not effected a general waiver of t h e attorney client privilege."
340 N.C. 435 (1995)l right
to
present evidence in his defense, which right is guaranteed by the Sixth
Amendment.
Defendant also argues that the exclusion of relevant evidence violates
defendant's
right to due process, which "is, in essence, the right to a fair opportunity to
defend
against the State's accusations."
Rule 10 functions as an important vehicle to insure
that
errors are not “built into” the record, thereby causing unnecessary
appellate review.
2d 832 (1982), that a failure to except or object to errors at
trial
constitutes a waiver of the right to assert the alleged error on appeal.
2d 375 (1983), we considered the
effect
of our Rule 10(b)(2)when no objection or exception was made at trial to
instructions
to the jury, and adopted there the “plain error” rule.
2d 804 (1983), we adopted the plain error rule “with equal
force” with
regard to Rule 10(b)(1)when no objection or exception was made at trial to
evidence
presented and admitted, stating that The rule that unless objection is made to
the
introduction of evidence at the time the evidence is offered, or unless there
is
a timely motion to strike the evidence, any objection thereto is deemed to have
been
waived is not simply a technical rule of procedure.
Were the rule otherwise, an
undue
if not impossible burden would be placed on the trial judge.
Since the party does not object a trial
judge
should not have to decide ‘on his own’ the soundness of a party’s trial
strategy.
Reading the language of Rule 10(b)(1)that an
exception
may be properly preserved “by objection noted or which by rule or law was
deemed
preserved or taken without any such action,” together with the language of
State
v. Black, 308 N.C. 736, 303 S.E.
A party may not, after trial and judgment,
comb
through the transcript of the proceedings and randomly insert an exception
notation
in disregard of the mandates of Rule 10(b).
Where no action was taken by
counsel
during the course of the proceedings, the burden is on the party alleging error
to
establish its right to review; that is, that an exception, “by rule or law was
deemed
preserved or taken without any such action,” or that the alleged error
constitutes
plain error.
In so doing, a party must, prior to arguing the alleged error in
his
brief, (a) alert the appellate court that no action was taken by counsel at the
trial
level, and (b) establish his right to review by asserting in what manner the
exception
is preserved by rule or law or, when applicable, how the error amounted to a
plain
error or defect affecting a substantial right which may be noticed although not
brought
to the attention of the trial court.
We caution that our review will be
carefully
limited to those errors ‘in the exceptional case where, after reviewing the
entire
record, it can be said the claimed error is a “fundamental error, something so
basic,
so prejudicial, so lacking in its elements that justice cannot have been
done,” or
“where the error is grave error which amounts to a denial of a fun“ damental
right
of the accused,” or the error has ‘resulted in a miscarriage of justice or
in the
denial to appellant of a fair ” trial’ or where the error is such as to
“seriously
affect the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings”
or where
it can be fairly said “the instructional mistake had a probable impact on the
jury’s
finding that the ’ defendant was guilty.” State v. Odom, 307 N.C. at 660,
300 S.E.
Because the record in the case under
consideration
was filed prior to Odom and Black, and because the case involves sentences of
death,
we have elected to review all errors assigned, whether properly objected to at
trial
or alleged for the first time on this appeal.
They can't be
introduced
unlesseither I testify or someone else does.
Miranda Rights Law Under Miranda v. Arizona (1966), suspects must be informed
of
their rights to remain silent and to an attorney when they are in custody and
subject
to interrogation.
Voluntariness of DNA Collection Law The standard you cited
indicates
that a DNA sample should not be taken without a probable cause determination if
the
arrest is without a warrant.
Application If the suspect was not formally
arrested
with a warrant or if no probable cause determination was made prior to the DNA
collection,
this could be a violation of the suspect's rights.
Right to Counsel Law
Suspects
have the right to be informed of their right to counsel during nontestimonial
identification
procedures, and to have counsel present, especially if they cannot afford one.
Application
The suspect inquired about needing a lawyer, which should have been adequately
addressed
by informing them of their right to legal representation.
Detention and
False
Statements by Law Enforcement Law Deceptive practices by police during
interrogation
can impact the admissibility of evidence and the voluntariness of statements
and
consent.
Application The detective's misleading statement minimizing the
seriousness
of the matter could be considered deceptive and coercive, especially when the
suspect
was subsequently detained and interrogated.
Conflict of Interest Law Ethical
standards
require law enforcement officers to disclose any potential conflicts of
interest
that could affect their handling of a case.
Procedural Requirements for
Nontestimonial
Identification Orders Law Such orders require specific conditions to be met,
including
a sworn affidavit establishing probable cause and the material aid of the
procedure
to the investigation.
Application If the nontestimonial identification
procedures
(such as the DNA sample) were conducted without adhering to these procedural
requirements,
it might be challenged as unlawful.
The test for determining whether
pretrial
publicity mandates a change of venue is whether "it is reasonably likely that
prospective
jurors would base their decision in the case upon pretrial information rather
than
the evidence presented at trial and would be unable to remove from their minds
any
preconceived impressions they might have formed."
Defendant has the burden of proving the
existence
of a reasonable likelihood that he cannot receive a fair trial in that county
on
account of prejudice from such pretrial publicity.
To meet this burden defendant must show that jurors have
prior
knowledge concerning the case, that he exhausted peremptory challenges and that
a
juror objectionable to the defendant sat on the jury.
In deciding whether a
defendant
has met his burden o ‚¬ showing prejudice, it is relevant to consider that
the chosen
jurors stated that they could ignore their prior knowledge or earlier formed
opinions
and decide the case solely on the evidence presented at trial.
The determination of
whether
a defendant has carried his burden of showing that pretrial publicity precluded
him
from receiving a fair trial rests within the trial court's sound discretion.
IN THE SUPREME COURT STATE v.
KNIGHT
340 N.C. 531 (1995)l "Only in the most extraordinary cases can an appellate
court
determine solely upon evidence adduced prior to the actual commencement of jury
selection
that a trial court has abused its discretion by denying a motion for change of
venue
due to existing prejudice against the defendant."
After reviewing
the
information submitted by defendant in support of his pretrial motion for change
of
venue, we conclude that the trial court did not err in concluding that
defendant
had not made a sufficient showing of prejudice.
For example the lack of investigation has left
people
in the community that are tangentially involved in the case but are not listed
in
any documents due to the failure of a proper investigation.
The State has also
essentially
placed the burden of proof on the defendant to prove innocence.
The Defendant
is
entitled to an investigation as much as the prosecution.
In
opening
remarks, counsel are permitted a limited preview of the evidence and allowed to
state
the "legal claim or defense in basic terms."
Paige, 316 N.C. at 648, 343 S.E.2d
at
859 (permissible for counsel in opening statement to state that the defendant
"would
rely on the presumption of innocence.
DEFENSE COUNSEL Objection.
A defendant is entitled to a new trial on the basis of an improper
question
if there is a reasonable possibility that such an improper question affected
the
outcome of his trial.
Merely asking an improper question to
which
an objection is sustained does not automatically result in prejudice to a
defendant.
When the trial court sustains a
defendant's
objections to improper questions and instructs the jury to disregard such
questions,
any possible prejudice to the defendant is cured.
"Our courts have recognized that there may be
selectivity
in prosecutions and that the exercise of this prosecutorial prerogative does
not
reach constitutional proportion unless there be a showing that the selection
was
deliberately based upon 'an unjustifiable standard such as race, religion or
other
arbitrary classification.'
In
order for a motion to preserve evidence to be effective, however, it should be
filed
as soon as possible.
Defense counsel should consider the need for this motion
when
beginning to investigate the case as a part of discovery preparation.
Key
Principles
This motion puts the State on notice that it must retain and preserve evidence
for
independent testing or examination.
Therefore, consider making a motion to
preserve
when there is a risk that the State may destroy or fail to preserve evidence
necessary
for the defense—for example, 911 tapes, digital surveillance, forensics, or
other
physical evidence that is at risk of decay or destruction due to retention
policies,
testing, passage of time, or any other reason.
In addition to ensuring complete
access
by the defense to evidence that otherwise may be lost or destroyed, filing this
motion
can assist in establishing a statutory or constitutional violation for the loss
or
destruction of evidence.
Practice Tips  A notice to preserve evidence should
be
tailored to a specific concern about particular evidence in the case.
The
notice
should identify the evidence that is of concern, specify the importance of that
evidence
to the defense, and specify the nature and extent of the concern of loss or
destruction
of the evidence.
For instance, jails and 911 call centers often have internal
policies
regarding retention of audio or video recordings, and labs often have policies
regarding
testing of small samples of materials that are likely to be destroyed in
testing.
Where possible, obtain and attach to the motion any policies of the entity with
possession
of the evidence that document the risk of loss or destruction of the evidence.
1, § 4.6C (Other Constitutional Rights—Lost or
Destroyed
Evidence).
F. Motion for Deposition Authority G.S.
Key Principles While rare in criminal
cases,
this statute allows for the use of depositions by the defense in limited
circumstances.
Where a material witness is
ill,
physically unable to attend trial, or resides in another state, the defendant
may
seek an order from the clerk of superior court of the jurisdiction where the
criminal
case is pending to take the deposition of the witness by filing an affidavit
and
request with the clerk.
The affidavit filed with the clerk must (1) include a
statement
that the testimony of the person sought to be deposed is important to the
defense;
(2) provide the witness’s name; and (3) state that the witness is physically
ill,
incapacitated, or is not a resident of North Carolina and that the witness
cannot
attend the trial.
By statute, the clerk is directed to appoint a person to take
the
deposition.
Counsel may consider informing the trial judge ahead of time of the
intent
to seek this request from the clerk.
This provision about criminal depositions
applies
to the defendant only; the State has no statutory right to obtain a deposition
in
a criminal case.
If a deposition is
obtained,
the statute states that the testimony from the deposition may be read at trial
in
the same manner that depositions may be used at civil trials, per Rule 32 of
the
N.C. Rules of Civil Procedure motions for change of venue under G.S.
Motion

This oversight raises concerns about the thoroughness of the investigation and the potential bias in witness selection.
This tactic raises ethical concerns about prosecutorial conduct and the integrity of the judicial process.
This selective approach to evidence collection undermines the prosecution's case and highlights the lack of thoroughness in the investigation.
Impeachment of Witnesses : The defense should be prepared to challenge the credibility of all witnesses, particularly those whose statements have changed over time or who have personal biases that could affect their testimony.
The combination of these factors not only undermines the prosecution's case but also raises serious concerns about the integrity of the judicial process.
A thorough review of all evidence, witness statements, and investigative practices is essential to ensure that justice is served and that any potential miscarriages of justice are rectified.
The defense must leverage these inconsistencies and the lack of physical evidence to mount a robust challenge against the charges, emphasizing the need for a fair and impartial trial free from coercion and bias.
They assess things such as Allegiance to the United States, Foreign Influence, Sexual Behavior, Personal Conduct, Financial Considerations, Alcohol Consumption, Drug Involvement, Psychological Conditions, and Criminal Conduct, among others.
The purpose is not to catch someone in a lie but to ensure that they’re trustworthy and able to handle the responsibilities that come with this clearance.
I repeatedly asked for a speedier trial but was pushed off by my attorneys.
The court ruled me indigent.
My attorneys were never allowed to review them and were not informed they were in the courthouse until we were already in court for trial.
This also brings to light something else my attorneys didn’t address.
For example, the visiting Judge finally learned that the medical records were downstairs in another Judge's box on the day of the trial.
I guess the scales of justice must be weighed with cash.

Legal Framework and Procedural Analysis
When a detective's familial relationship with a witness and bias in an affidavit for arrest are at play, the legal framework revolves around principles of due process, evidence integrity, and the credibility of law enforcement actions.
The foundational elements to consider include:
Constitutional Protections: The U.S. Constitution, particularly the Fourth Amendment's protections against unreasonable searches and seizures and the Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause, provides the bedrock for examining the legality of the detective's actions and the affidavit's integrity.
Legal Standards for Evidence: The admissibility of evidence in court is governed by standards that ensure fairness and reliability, as outlined in the Federal Rules of Evidence and comparable state rules.
Precedential Case Law: Key Supreme Court decisions establish the legal precedents that guide how courts handle issues of bias, credibility, and procedural errors in criminal investigations and prosecutions.
Legal Concern: The potential for bias affecting the witness's testimony and the investigation's integrity.
Procedural Analysis: Courts may scrutinize the evidence and testimony provided by the witness more closely, considering the familial relationship as a factor that could undermine the objectivity of the witness's statements.
Bias in the Affidavit for Arrest:
Basic Element: Integrity and truthfulness of statements leading to an arrest.
Legal Concern: Whether the bias compromised the affidavit's reliability, potentially violating constitutional rights.
Procedural Analysis: A challenge to the affidavit based on alleged bias could lead to a suppression hearing (Franks v. Delaware), where the defense can argue that the initial bias taints the arrest and any evidence derived from it, thus inadmissible.
Relevant Cases
Brady v. Maryland | 373 U.S. 83 (1963) 
Obligation to disclose exculpatory evidence.
Highlights the importance of fairness in proceedings relevant to disclosing biases.
Franks v. Delaware | 438 U.S. 154 (1978) 
Right to challenge false statements in warrant affidavits.
| Provides a procedural avenue for addressing bias in the affidavit for arrest.
Conclusion
The scenario's analysis, grounded in First Principles Thinking, underscores the critical importance of ensuring procedural integrity and the accused's constitutional rights.
The detective's familial relationship with a witness and the bias in the affidavit for arrest introduce significant legal challenges that must be navigated with a deep understanding of constitutional protections, evidence standards, and the overarching principle of fairness in the criminal justice system.
Violations and Illegal Acts:
a) Brady Violations: The prosecution appears to have committed several Brady violations by failing to disclose exculpatory evidence.
In Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963), the Supreme Court held that the suppression of evidence favorable to an accused violates due process where the evidence is material either to guilt or to punishment, irrespective of the good faith or bad faith of the prosecution.
b) Perjury and Subornation of Perjury: There are strong indications of perjury by multiple witnesses and potential subornation of perjury by the prosecution.
§ 14-209, perjury is a serious offense.
In North Carolina, malicious prosecution requires proof of: (1) the defendant initiated the earlier proceeding; (2) malice on the part of the defendant in doing so; (3) lack of probable cause for the initiation of the earlier proceeding; and (4) termination of the earlier proceeding in favor of the plaintiff.
d) Civil Rights Violations: The actions of law enforcement and the prosecution may constitute violations of Mr. Allen's civil rights under 42 U.S.C.
This statute allows individuals to sue state government employees and others acting "under color of state law" for civil rights violations.
Potential violations include:
Unlawful arrest without probable cause
Malicious prosecution
Fabrication of evidence
e) Prosecutorial Misconduct: The ADA's actions, including offering a plea deal based on false information and potentially presenting false evidence to the grand jury, may constitute prosecutorial misconduct.
In Berger v. United States, 295 U.S. 78 (1935), the Supreme Court held that a prosecutor's interest in a criminal case is not that they shall win, but that justice shall be done.
As we delve deeper into these violations and illegal acts, it's important to consider the systemic implications.
How might these actions reflect broader issues within the local justice system?
As we delve into these aspects, it's crucial to consider how seemingly minor missteps or oversights can compound, leading to significant miscarriages of justice.
We must also consider the potential motivations behind these actions - whether they stem from incompetence, bias, or more deliberate attempts to manipulate the justice system.
Relevant case law: In Miller v. Pate, 386 U.S. 1 (1967), the Supreme Court held that the Fourteenth Amendment cannot tolerate a state criminal conviction obtained by the knowing use of false evidence.
This is a severe violation of ethical standards and potentially constitutes fraud upon the court.
Relevant case law: In Napue v. Illinois, 360 U.S. 264 (1959), the Court held that the Fourteenth Amendment is violated when the State, although not soliciting false evidence, allows it to go uncorrected when it appears.
This failure to secure and analyze physical evidence is a significant deviation from standard investigative procedures.
f) Inadequate Documentation: The lack of proper documentation, including incomplete or inaccurate reports, and the absence of a clear chain of custody for evidence, indicates substandard investigative practices.
These investigative failures raise serious questions about the training and oversight of law enforcement in this jurisdiction.
How might systemic issues contribute to such widespread neglect of proper procedures?
As we examine these aspects, it's important to consider how adherence to proper investigative procedures serves not only to protect the rights of the accused but also to ensure the integrity of the justice system as a whole.
We must also consider how the failure to follow these procedures can undermine public trust in law enforcement and the courts.
This includes:

Failure to secure and document the scene properly
Lack of systematic evidence collection
Failure to take comprehensive photographs of the alleged crime scene
Neglect in collecting potential DNA evidence from bedding and other relevant surfaces

Relevant standard: The National Institute of Justice's "Crime Scene Investigation: A Guide for Law Enforcement" provides detailed procedures that should have been followed.
Potential Violations of State and Federal Laws:

a) Fourth Amendment Violations:
The arrest of Mr. Allen without proper probable cause may constitute a violation of his Fourth Amendment rights against unreasonable seizures.
Case law: In Henry v. United States, 361 U.S. 98 (1959), the Supreme Court held that probable cause exists if the facts and circumstances known to the officer warrant a prudent man in believing that an offense has been committed.
b) Fourteenth Amendment Due Process Violations:
The numerous issues with the investigation and prosecution, including Brady violations and the use of false evidence, likely constitute violations of Mr. Allen's Fourteenth Amendment right to due process.
Case law: In United States v. Agurs, 427 U.S. 97 (1976), the Court held that the prosecution's duty to disclose evidence encompasses impeachment evidence as well as exculpatory evidence.
d) North Carolina General Statute § 15A-903 - Disclosure of Evidence by the State:
The prosecution's failure to disclose exculpatory evidence and potential manipulation of evidence likely violates this statute, which requires the state to provide the defendant with all materials and information in its possession that are favorable to the defendant.
e) North Carolina Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 3.8 - Special Responsibilities of a Prosecutor:
The ADA's actions, including the misrepresentation of DNA evidence and potential presentation of false evidence to the grand jury, likely violate this rule, which outlines the ethical obligations of prosecutors.
$antthinking$ The extent and nature of these overlooked procedures and potential legal violations suggest a systemic failure in the local justice system.
It raises questions about the adequacy of training, the effectiveness of oversight mechanisms, and the culture within the law enforcement and prosecutorial agencies.
How might these issues be addressed to prevent similar miscarriages of justice in the future?
As we delve into this critical aspect of the case, it's essential to approach the analysis with a keen awareness of the balance between public safety concerns and individual rights.
We must scrutinize each element that contributed to the decision to arrest Mr. Allen, considering both the letter of the law and the spirit of justice it aims to uphold.
Probable Cause Analysis:
Legal Standard for Probable Cause:
Probable cause is defined as a reasonable belief that a person has committed a crime.
The U.S. Supreme Court in Illinois v. Gates, 462 U.S. 213 (1983), established that probable cause is determined based on the "totality of the circumstances."
This requires a practical, common-sense decision whether, given all the circumstances, there is a fair probability that a crime has been committed and that the suspect committed it.
As stated in State v. Biber, 365 N.C. 162, 712 S.E.2d 874 (2011), "Probable cause requires only a probability or substantial chance of criminal activity, not an actual showing of such activity."
Examination of Factors Considered for Probable Cause:
a) Accuser's Statement: Lauren Deal's statement was the primary basis for the arrest.
However, several issues undermine its reliability:
Inconsistencies in her account, particularly regarding the timeline of events
Her admitted consumption of alcohol, which could affect her recollection
The lack of immediate reporting, which allowed time for potential fabrication or influence from others
Case law: In State v. Knoll, 322 N.C. 535, 369 S.E.2d 558 (1988), the North Carolina Supreme Court held that an officer must consider the totality of the circumstances, including the credibility of the complainant, when determining probable cause.
770, 803 S.E.2d 419 (2017), the court emphasized the importance of considering all available evidence, including exculpatory evidence, in determining probable cause.
Case law: In Franks v. Delaware, 438 U.S. 154 (1978), the Supreme Court held that a defendant is entitled to a hearing if they can make a substantial preliminary showing that a false statement knowingly and intentionally, or with reckless disregard for the truth, was included in a warrant affidavit.
This conflict of interest taints the entire process.
In State v. Campbell, 282 N.C. 125, 191 S.E.2d 752 (1972), the North Carolina Supreme Court emphasized the importance of corroborating evidence in establishing probable cause.
1999), the court held that an officer has a duty to conduct a reasonably thorough investigation prior to arresting a suspect, including consideration of exculpatory evidence.
$antthinking$ The numerous flaws in the probable cause determination in this case point to a systemic issue in how law enforcement and prosecutors approach sexual assault allegations.
While it's crucial to take such allegations seriously, this case illustrates the dangers of abandoning due diligence and the presumption of innocence in the pursuit of a quick arrest.
How might we balance the need to support victims with the constitutional rights of the accused?
This failure to establish proper probable cause has significant implications for the case:
The arrest itself may be deemed unlawful, potentially leading to the suppression of any evidence obtained as a result of the arrest under the "fruit of the poisonous tree" doctrine.
It calls into question the integrity of the entire investigation and subsequent prosecution, potentially leading to dismissal of all charges.
It highlights the need for better training and oversight in law enforcement agencies to prevent similar miscarriages of justice in the future.
As we consider these remedies and strategies, it's crucial to balance aggressive defense tactics with an awareness of the broader implications for the justice system.
We must consider not only what will best serve Mr. Allen's interests, but also how these actions might contribute to systemic improvements in law enforcement and prosecutorial practices.
Potential Remedies and Defense Strategies:
Motion to Suppress Evidence: Given the lack of probable cause for Mr. Allen's arrest, a motion to suppress all evidence obtained as a result of the arrest should be filed under the "fruit of the poisonous tree" doctrine established in Wong Sun v. United States, 371 U.S. 471 (1963).
Strategy: Argue that the arrest was unlawful due to lack of probable cause, and therefore any evidence obtained as a result, including statements made by Mr. Allen and physical evidence collected, should be excluded from trial.
Case law: In State v. Gant, 361 N.C. 389, 646 S.E.2d 727 (2007), the North Carolina Supreme Court held that evidence obtained as a result of an unlawful arrest must be suppressed.
Motion to Dismiss Charges: File a motion to dismiss all charges based on the violation of Mr. Allen's constitutional rights and the lack of credible evidence supporting the charges.
Strategy: Argue that the combination of Fourth Amendment violations (unlawful arrest), Brady violations, and prosecutorial misconduct has irreparably prejudiced Mr. Allen's right to a fair trial.
Case law: In State v. Lamb, 321 N.C. 633, 365 S.E.2d 600 (1988), the North Carolina Supreme Court held that dismissal is appropriate when there has been irreparable prejudice to the defendant's preparation of his case.
Legal Analysis:
Probable cause requires facts and circumstances that would lead a reasonable person to believe a crime has been committed.
The standard is lower than beyond reasonable doubt but higher than mere suspicion.
Case Law:
Illinois v. Gates, 462 U.S. 213 (1983) established the "totality of the circumstances" test for probable cause.
Beck v. Ohio, 379 U.S. 89 (1964) held that probable cause exists when "the facts and circumstances within the officers' knowledge and of which they had reasonably trustworthy information are sufficient in themselves to warrant a man of reasonable caution in the belief that an offense has been or is being committed."
This is an excellent question that requires careful analysis of Miranda doctrine and its application to custodial interrogations.
To properly assess when Miranda warnings should have been given to Ben Allen, we need to consider several key Supreme Court cases and their implications.
First, let's review the foundational case:
Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966)
Established that police must inform suspects of their rights before a custodial interrogation
Rights include: right to remain silent, right to an attorney, warning that statements can be used against them
The key question here is whether Ben Allen was in "custody" for Miranda purposes during this interview.
The test for custody is not simply whether the person is at a police station, but whether a reasonable person would feel free to leave.
Relevant cases on custody determination:
Oregon v. Mathiason, 429 U.S. 492 (1977)
Voluntary arrival at police station and brief questioning did not constitute custody
Court emphasized importance of coercive environment, not just location
California v. Beheler, 463 U.S. 1121 (1983)
Reinforced that Miranda only applies to custodial interrogation
Voluntary interview at police station without arrest was not custodial
Thompson v. Keohane, 516 U.S. 99 (1995)
Outlined two-part inquiry for custody: a) Circumstances surrounding interrogation b) Given those circumstances, would a reasonable person have felt free to terminate the interrogation and leave
Yarborough v. Alvarado, 541 U.S. 652 (2004)
Custody determination should be based on objective circumstances, not subjective views of the interrogating officers or person being questioned
Applying these principles to Ben Allen's situation:
He came to the station voluntarily
The conversation seems relatively casual at the start
He expresses concerns about his job, suggesting he's thinking about consequences
There's no indication he was told he couldn't leave
However, the turning point may be when Detective Freeman starts asking specific questions about the night's events.
At this point, the interaction becomes more of an interrogation about potential criminal activity.
Berkemer v. McCarty, 468 U.S. 420 (1984) held that Miranda applies when a suspect is subjected to restraints comparable to those associated with formal arrest.
The key is whether there's a "formal arrest or restraint on freedom of movement of the degree associated with formal arrest."
It's worth noting that failure to give Miranda warnings doesn't necessarily make the arrest itself unlawful, but it could result in suppression of any incriminating statements made during the interrogation.
United States v. Patane, 542 U.S. 630 (2004) held that physical evidence obtained as a result of unwarned statements is still admissible, absent actual coercion.
The exact point is somewhat subjective, but err on the side of caution to protect the admissibility of any statements made.
This is an important question that requires careful consideration of legal ethics, professional standards for law enforcement, and the broader implications for justice and due process.
Let's analyze the detective's behavior through multiple lenses:
Legal and Procedural Ethics:

Miranda Warnings: As discussed previously, the detective should have given Miranda warnings once the conversation turned into a focused interrogation about potential criminal activity.
Failure to do so could be seen as an attempt to circumvent constitutional protections.
This lack of transparency could be seen as manipulative and potentially violating the spirit, if not the letter, of laws designed to protect suspects' rights.
This ambiguity could be seen as a form of subtle coercion.
Professional Ethics:

Duty of Candor: Law enforcement officers have an ethical duty to be truthful and transparent in their dealings with the public.
The detective's approach here seems to skirt the edges of this duty.
Abuse of Power: By leveraging the casual nature of the conversation to elicit information without proper warnings, the detective could be seen as abusing his position of authority.
Investigative Integrity: While the detective is gathering information, his methods could potentially compromise the integrity of the investigation if key statements are later deemed inadmissible.
Ethical Frameworks:

Utilitarian Perspective: One could argue that the detective's actions serve the greater good by potentially solving a crime.
However, this view ignores the long-term societal costs of eroding trust in law enforcement and potentially convicting someone without due process.
Deontological Ethics: From a duty-based ethical standpoint, the detective's actions are problematic.
Virtue Ethics: The detective's behavior doesn't align well with virtues we'd hope to see in law enforcement, such as honesty, transparency, and respect for individual rights.
Legal Precedents:
In Spano v. New York, 360 U.S. 315 (1959), the Supreme Court emphasized the importance of fair interrogation practices, stating: "The abhorrence of society to the use of involuntary confessions does not turn alone on their inherent untrustworthiness.
It also turns on the deep-rooted feeling that the police must obey the law while enforcing the law."
This sentiment underscores the ethical imperative for law enforcement to adhere to high standards of conduct, even when investigating serious crimes.
Conclusion:
While the detective's actions may not rise to the level of overt misconduct, they do raise significant ethical concerns.
The approach taken appears to prioritize information gathering over respect for the suspect's rights and the integrity of the legal process.
This type of behavior, if widespread, could undermine public trust in law enforcement and the justice system as a whole.
A more ethical approach would involve:

Clearly informing Allen of his status as a suspect
Providing Miranda warnings at the appropriate time
Ensuring Allen understands he's free to leave
Being more transparent about the nature and purpose of the questioning

Ultimately, while effective law enforcement is crucial for public safety, it must be balanced with respect for individual rights and the ethical principles that underpin our justice system.
The detective's behavior in this case falls short of the high ethical standards we should expect from law enforcement professionals.
This analysis provides a comprehensive breakdown of the appellate court's decision, examining the factual background, procedural history, legal issues, court's holdings, and the reasoning behind the judgment.
The analysis integrates perspectives akin to those of the highest judicial authorities, ensuring a thorough exploration of the legal principles and factors influencing the court's determination.

Constitutional Protections: Strengthens the enforcement of constitutional rights, ensuring that defendants are afforded due process.
Appellate Review: Exemplifies the appellate process's role in correcting trial court errors, maintaining the integrity of the judicial system.
Legal practitioners and scholars may reference this case for its detailed analysis and application of North Carolina law, particularly in areas related to [specific legal issues addressed in the case].
They assess things such as Allegiance to the United States, Foreign Influence, Sexual Behavior, Personal Conduct, Financial Considerations, Alcohol Consumption, Drug Involvement, Psychological Conditions, and Criminal Conduct, among others.
The purpose is not to catch someone in a lie but to ensure that they’re trustworthy and able to handle the responsibilities that come with this clearance.
I repeatedly asked for a speedier trial but was pushed off by my attorneys.
The court ruled me indigent.
My attorneys were never allowed to review them and were not informed they were in the courthouse until we were already in court for trial.
This also brings to light something else my attorneys didn’t address.
For example, the visiting Judge finally learned that the medical records were downstairs in another Judge's box on the day of the trial.
I guess the scales of justice must be weighed with cash.
There are several issues with the case, so I will only address one that will give you a broad overview of the conduct of those involved in the judicial process in Lee County, NC.
How an experienced attorney who previously held a judgeship could make such an error is in question and is ripe for review.
It is also in violation of the Absolute Impasse Rule.
It was a tactic the District Attorney’s office used to systematically drain my resources so I would have no means to defend myself.
My attorneys were never allowed to review them and were not informed they were in the courthouse until we were already in court for trial.
This also brings to light something else my attorneys didn’t address.
For example, the visiting Judge finally learned that the medical records were downstairs in another Judge's box on the day of the trial.
I guess the scales of justice must be weighed with cash.
This affidavit was written well after the defendant was arrested, giving him ample time to review the video evidence handed over by the defense, which was only a couple of days later.
Inference: The knowledge of falsity satisfies the mens rea for a Franks challenge; knowing tolerance at trial triggers Napue/Giglio exposure.
Napue v. Illinois / Giglio v. United States (Knowing Use of False Testimony or Failure to Correct)
At Trial: The State elicited and leaned on the timeline despite contradictory objective evidence (video) and divergent witness interviews.
Validation: The video is objective and decisive; non-correction of an impossibility supports a Napue theory.
Even setting aside the fact that the defendant has no grip strength in his left hand due to a documented injury—an injury the prosecution either failed to uncover or chose to ignore—the physical differences in height and weight between the parties made the claim mechanically impossible.
Go ahead and invite them back in the courtroom.
Legal Implications:
Fourth Amendment violation — probable cause must exist before a warrantless arrest; here, it was established post-arrest.
Franks v. Delaware issue — any later warrant or affidavit implying earlier probable cause is misleading.
Potential perjury or material misrepresentation if his testimony intentionally conflated the sequence to obscure an unlawful arrest.
Can you sort of just describe just very generally the layout of the house for the jury?
State's Exhibit number four, I guess, is the beginning of a conversation that you had with the defendant in this matter, Mr. Allen?
THE COURT:  What's the basis of your objection?
THE COURT:  What are you referring to?
The court conditionally admitted the first page under Rule 104(b)/Rule 901 principles: if the witness testifies that there was a prior discussion, that testimony would supply the context/authentication the court thought necessary.
Does that satisfy the court’s condition?
Practical move
Renew your objection and move to strike the admitted page for failure of the 104(b) condition; request a curative instruction directing the jury to disregard Exhibit 4’s first page.
Alternatively (if strategic), invoke Rule of Completeness (106) to introduce the later pages precisely to underscore the “other user” problem—while making clear the State never laid the foundational “prior discussion” the court required.
5) They will lie and trample your rights just to get their way.

Freeman
I have much more to write and don't want to send it all at once.
He offered to talk to the magistrate on my behalf to get my bail lowered after arresting me for a brutal crime.
North Carolina General Statute § 15A-601 states that a defendant must be taken before a magistrate "without unnecessary delay."
They are surface-level lies that would be good for Law enforcement that just needs an excuse to violate someone’s rights.
They have proved that they will lie and trample your rights…I was gonna say to get there way but they have been doing it just because.
This might not be enough to restore faith that an impartial investigation was done, allowing the defendant to have a fair trial.
Attempted Extortion by the Accuser’s Friend:
Legal Aspect: Extortion is a criminal offense.
Joel Kelly’s attempt to extort money from the defendant in exchange for making the case go away is a serious legal issue and could be charged separately.
The demand for $150,000 to disappear the case motivates other illicit behavior of persons involved, especially those with a familial connection.
Impact: This revelation could have severely damaged the prosecution’s case.
The jury Forman stated if this were brought out during the trial the defendant would have been immediately acquitted.
Handling the Conflicts and Extortion:
Investigation: The extortion attempt should have been thoroughly investigated as a separate criminal matter.
The client was informed of the decision during his trial.
Maintaining integrity, impartiality, and fairness of the legal process is essential.
If the extortion attempt or the conflict of interest significantly undermines the credibility of crucial witnesses or the investigation's credibility, it might affect the decision to proceed with the case.
The District Attorney may need to evaluate how her Assistant District Attorney has handled this case.
Potential Defense Strategies:
Highlighting Biases and Motives: The defense attorneys should have brought the omissions of the state to the court and then exposed the unethical behavior of those representing the state to cast doubt on the integrity of the investigation, the validity of the case, and the credibility of the accuser’s claims.
Motion to Dismiss: The defense should have immediately filed a motion to dismiss.
Every aspect of the case has been undermined by illegal and unethical behavior from everyone but the defendant.
This case should be brought before an ethical review panel.
Impact on the Jury:
Perception of Impropriety: If the defense attorneys had used the misconduct as part of the defense, it could have significantly influenced the jury’s perception of the case, potentially leading them to question the motives and truthfulness of the prosecution’s witnesses.
Challenges in Jury Selection: The prosecutor would have likely been very thorough in jury selection to identify and exclude potential jurors who may be biased due to the disclosed conflicts, while the defense would have done something similar, adding another level of complexity to the case.
This would have further burdened the defendant, who had no role in the misconduct of the representatives of the state, adding another element that prejudices the defendant's ability to have a fair trial.
Ethical Obligations of Legal Professionals:
Prosecutor’s Responsibility: The prosecutor must assess whether they can continue the case in good faith, given the potential conflicts and the extortion attempt.
The extortion should still be investigated to see if charges should be brought.
Defense Obligations: The defense has a duty to vigorously represent their client, including bringing up these issues to challenge the prosecution’s case.

Benjamin Allen Case File: A Systemic Breakdown of Justice
Forward – Content Reference
This report on the Benjamin Allen case file uncovers a disturbing panorama of failures within the criminal justice system, demanding an urgent and thorough investigation.
The extensive misconduct and procedural violations detailed in this report are profoundly concerning, illustrating both isolated errors and a systemic failure of justice.
This is not a mere oversight; it strikes at the heart of impartiality, a cornerstone of any legitimate investigation.
As Justice Louis Brandeis articulated in Olmstead v. United States, a landmark case on the Fourth Amendment and the right to privacy, "Decency, security, and liberty alike demand that government officials shall be subjected to the same rules of conduct that are commands to the citizen."
This directly violates the principle of due process, as the very foundation of the investigation becomes suspect.
This selective investigation echoes the concerns raised by Justice Black , consistently warning against shortcuts and biases in law enforcement that undermine individual liberties.
Crime Scene Neglect: The report meticulously documents the egregious failures in crime scene processing.
This is not a technicality but a fundamental failure to adhere to established investigative standards, as meticulously outlined in crime scene investigation protocols.
As Justice Holmes famously stated, "The life of the law has not been logic; it has been experience."
Lack of Authentication: The documented breaches in the chain of custody, coupled with the failure to authenticate crucial pieces of evidence like the pants allegedly belonging to the accuser, raise serious questions about the integrity and admissibility of evidence presented at trial.
Without a proper chain of custody and authentication, the evidentiary value of these items is severely compromised, undermining the foundation of the prosecution's narrative.
This is not merely a procedural oversight; it directly affects the reliability and trustworthiness of the evidence upon which a trial can be held.
This directly implicates Brady v. Maryland.
The cumulative effect of these false statements and omissions undermines the probable cause upon which the arrest and subsequent prosecution were predicated.
Brady Violations
Probable Cause Defects
Procedural Omissions
False Timeline Reporting
Legal Requirement for Reporting: In North Carolina, hospitals are legally obligated to report cases of suspected assault, abuse, or other injuries that may involve criminal activity.
Failure to report such cases to law enforcement can result in felony charges against the hospital staff or administration.
This mandatory reporting requirement ensures that law enforcement is promptly notified in cases involving potential crimes, thereby enabling immediate investigation and evidence preservation.
If CCH failed to report the incident to law enforcement, or if they did report but records are now being withheld, this could represent a serious breach of legal obligations and raise questions about collusion or mishandling.
Legal Consequences for Non-Compliance: If it is found that CCH did not fulfill its reporting obligation, it could be subject to legal consequences, including potential felony charges.
Furthermore, failing to comply with reporting laws raises suspicion that hospital staff, law enforcement, or both may have had a reason to avoid documenting this case correctly.
An arrangement between hospital staff and law enforcement to circumvent standard reporting protocols would be highly irregular and potentially unlawful, implying a deliberate effort to delay or obscure initial investigatory actions.
Withholding these records is an attempt to obstruct justice as law enforcement and hospital staff sought to avoid initiating a formal investigation to protect individuals involved.
Possibility of Collusion:
A deliberate attempt to avoid creating a formal record of the incident indicates collusion between hospital staff and law enforcement to keep the case off the books until a more convenient time.
This collusion is a serious breach of ethical and legal standards, indicating that personal interests and relationships influenced official duties.
The arrangement was made to postpone investigatory action, which constitutes obstruction of justice and has serious legal ramifications for all parties involved.
The failure to release 911 records and other relevant documentation is grounds for questioning the validity of the initial investigation and the defendant's arrest.
If these records continue to be withheld, the defense should seek a subpoena to compel their release.
Prosecutorial Misconduct
The conduct of the Assistant District Attorney (ADA) detailed in this report is equally, if not more, alarming.
It reveals a pattern of behavior that suggests a conscious disregard for ethical obligations and due process, actively compounding the investigative failures.
This is not aggressive advocacy, but outright deception intended to coerce a guilty plea under false pretenses.
In Miranda v. Arizona, a case that established the principle of the right to remain silent, Justice Warren emphasized the importance of protecting individuals against coercion within the legal system.
The ADA's actions violate this principle, exploit the defendant's vulnerability, and undermine the integrity of the plea-bargaining process, potentially leading to a wrongful conviction.
Withholding exculpatory evidence and failing to disclose critical material directly violate Brady obligations.
The cumulative effect of these actions systematically disadvantages the defense, undermining their ability to prepare a strong case and effectively challenge the prosecution's narrative.
This procedural manipulation directly infringes upon the defendant's Sixth Amendment right to effective counsel and a fair trial, highlighting the systemic issues in the case, where both the investigative and prosecutorial sides appear to be working against the defendant.
Discovery Violations: 
Procedural Abuse:  The egregious delay of thirty-seven continuances over four years is not merely inefficiency; it constitutes a deliberate abuse of the legal process and a blatant violation of the defendant's Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial.
Justice Brennan eloquently wrote in Klopfer v. North Carolina the right to a speedy trial is "as fundamental as any of the rights secured by the Sixth Amendment."
The prosecution's systematic delays, resulting in lost evidence, witness memory degradation, and profound emotional and financial hardship for the defendant, are inexcusable and further solidify the impression of a system actively working against the defendant, rather than impartially seeking justice.
Speedy Trial Violations:
Failure to Correct False Testimony: The report points out that the ADA repeatedly refused to correct known false testimony, directly contravening the precedent set in Napue v. Illinois.
Allowing perjured testimony to stand uncorrected is a fundamental breach of prosecutorial ethics and a violation of due process.
Furthermore, the alleged misuse of grand jury processes by introducing misleading evidence and false testimony undermines the integrity of this critical pre-trial stage.
These actions suggest a pattern of intentional manipulation of the legal system to secure an indictment and an attempt at a subsequent conviction, regardless of the veracity of the evidence.
Misuse of Grand Jury: 
Judge Shopping: The ADA intentionally manipulated procedural mechanisms—such as repeatedly requesting continuances—to secure a specific judge favorable to the prosecution, thereby undermining judicial impartiality and fairness.
This practice violates defendants' constitutional rights under the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses and the Sixth Amendment's right to a fair trial by compromising judicial neutrality, as established clearly in Caperton v. A.T. Massey Coal Co., Tumey v. Ohio, and Ward v. Village of Monroeville.
Failure to Investigate Critical Leads:
Procedural Omissions 
Brady Violations

III.
Ineffective Assistance of Counsel
The report outlines a deeply concerning scenario of ineffective assistance of counsel, further stacking the odds against the defendant.
This inaction directly prejudiced the defendant's ability to challenge the prosecution's case and present a robust defense.
As Justice Marshall consistently emphasized, the right to counsel is not merely the right to have a lawyer but effective legal representation.
The reported failures suggest a profound deficiency in this critical constitutional guarantee.
Such a conflict could reasonably compromise the attorney's impartiality and willingness to attack the detective's investigation.
Furthermore, the reported refusal of defense counsel to file speedy trial motions, despite the egregious delays and the defendant's explicit requests, is a shocking abdication of their responsibility to protect their client's constitutional rights.
This inaction suggests gross incompetence or, more disturbingly, a potential complicity in the systemic failures that plagued this case.
Denial of Speedy Trial Claim: 
Loss of Phone Data and The defense firm's inexplicable loss of the defendant's phone and extracted data is a deeply troubling event.
While attributed to defense counsel, it underscores this case's systemic vulnerability to evidence loss.
The potential exculpatory nature of this lost data further exacerbates the concerns about a fair trial being compromised.
Regardless of fault, losing potentially critical evidence further obscures the truth and weakens the defendant's ability to mount a defense.
Procedural Omissions: 
Probable Cause Defects: 

IV.
Systemic Corruption and Confirmation Bias
Beyond the individual instances of misconduct and error, the report paints a disturbing picture of potential systemic corruption and deeply ingrained confirmation bias within the Lee County justice system.
This suggests a system where personal connections and potential undue influence compromise impartiality and fairness.
Such systemic corruption, if substantiated, would represent a profound betrayal of public trust and a fundamental threat to the rule of law.
Systemic Integrity Concerns:
Structural Prejudice:
Jury Verdict Rejected

Double Jeopardy: The proceedings in the initial trial, specifically the jury's communication to the court during deliberations, establish a de facto acquittal on the charge of first-degree forcible rape.
Consequently, retrying the defendant on this charge would violate fundamental double jeopardy principles under North Carolina law and general jurisprudence.
North Carolina Law Mandating Unanimous Jury Verdicts
The legal framework of North Carolina robustly protects the right to a unanimous jury verdict in criminal proceedings.
Section 24 of Article I of the Constitution of North Carolina underpins this right, ensuring that no individual can be convicted of a crime without the unanimous consent of a jury of their peers.
General Statute § 15A-1201(a) explicitly mandates that, absent a waiver by the defendant pursuant to § 15A-1201(b), a defendant in a criminal trial possesses the right to be tried by a jury of twelve, and that the verdict rendered by this jury must be unanimous.
Further procedural safeguards are detailed in General Statute § 15A-1237, which prescribes the essential elements of a valid criminal verdict.
This statute dictates that all criminal verdicts must adhere to the following criteria:
Written Form: The verdict must be documented in writing.
Foreperson Signature: The written verdict must be signed by the jury foreperson.
Unanimity: The verdict must reflect the unanimous agreement of all jurors.
Open Court Return: The verdict must be formally returned by the jury in open court.
Record Inclusion: The verdict must be officially incorporated into the court record.
The legislative intent behind the written verdict requirement, as elucidated in the Official Commentary to G.S.
15A-1237 and State v. Goodman, 298 N.C. 1 (1979), is to mitigate potential inaccuracies and omissions that could occur during the oral pronouncement of a verdict by the foreperson.
However, North Carolina jurisprudence has also recognized that strict adherence to procedural formalities should not supersede the precise substance of a jury's decision.
685 (2004), verdicts have been upheld despite minor procedural oversights, indicating a pragmatic approach where the core elements of a valid verdict are demonstrably present.
De Facto Acquittal Established by Jury Communication in the Allen Case
The official court transcript of the Allen case proceedings contains a critical exchange that firmly supports the argument for a de facto acquittal on the first-degree forcible rape charge.
The relevant excerpt is as follows:
[The jury entered the courtroom and were seated in jury box]
THE COURT: All right.
However, we're split nine to three on the lesser charge of second-degree forcible rape.
Read in open court FOR THE RECORD.
This exchange reveals that the jury foreperson submitted a written communication, bearing his signature, to the presiding judge.
Upon receiving this written communication, the judge acknowledged its written and signed nature in open court and, significantly, read it aloud "FOR THE RECORD."
This judicial action of reading the jury's note into the official record is paramount.
While the jury did not utilize a pre-printed verdict form designated explicitly for a "not guilty" verdict on first-degree rape, their written, signed communication, delivered through the foreperson and officially recorded by the court, substantively fulfills the core requirements of G.S.
The written note, signed by the foreperson, unequivocally declares the unanimous decision of the jury regarding the first-degree rape charge.
The explicit statement by the judge to record this communication further solidifies its official status within the trial proceedings.
Drawing upon the pragmatic approach adopted by North Carolina courts, as exemplified in State v. Collins and State v. Simmons, a rigid adherence to a specific verdict form should not eclipse the clear and officially documented unanimous decision of the jury.
15A-1237, to ensure accuracy and prevent errors, is demonstrably met by the written jury note that was formally integrated into the court record.
Fundamental Principles of Double Jeopardy
The principle of double jeopardy, deeply rooted in Anglo-American jurisprudence, dictates that an individual shall not be twice placed in jeopardy for the same offense.
This protection is designed to prevent the state, with its vast resources, from repeatedly attempting to convict an individual for an alleged crime.
The fundamental tenet of double jeopardy is that a verdict of acquittal, once rendered, is final and cannot be overturned or ignored.
To subject Mr. Allen to a retrial on the charge of first-degree forcible rape, after the jury in his initial trial unequivocally communicated their unanimous "not guilty" decision to the court and had it officially recorded, would directly contravene these foundational principles.
Such an action would undermine the finality of jury decisions and erode the protections afforded by the double jeopardy clause.
The defendant possesses a valued right to have their trial concluded by a particular tribunal.
For the foregoing reasons, we respectfully submit that the proceedings in the initial trial of Benjamin Allen established a de facto acquittal on the charge of first-degree forcible rape.
While emphasizing procedural safeguards for jury verdicts, North Carolina law also recognizes the primacy of the jury's substantive decision.
The jury's written, signed note, read into the record in open court, clearly and unequivocally expresses their unanimous determination of not guilty on the first-degree rape charge.
Retrying Mr. Allen on this charge would violate the fundamental protections against double jeopardy under North Carolina law and broader principles of justice.
We therefore urge the Court to recognize the de facto acquittal and dismiss the charge of first-degree forcible rape with prejudice, ensuring that Mr. Allen is not subjected to the injustice of being placed twice in jeopardy for an offense for which he has already been acquitted.
Conclusion: A Clarion Call for Justice and Systemic Reform
The Benjamin Allen case is not merely a chronicle of errors and missteps; it is a damning indictment of systemic failures, procedural violations, and misconduct that demand immediate and comprehensive review.
The sheer volume and gravity of the issues raised – from investigative bias and prosecutorial overreach to ineffective defense counsel and potential systemic corruption – paint a profoundly compromised justice system.
A comprehensive re-examination of the evidence, witness testimonies, and procedural records is imperative.
Furthermore, systemic reforms are urgently needed to prevent future miscarriages of justice, including enhanced oversight of investigative and prosecutorial conduct, robust mechanisms for addressing ineffective assistance of counsel, and stringent safeguards against potential conflicts of interest and systemic corruption.
The principles of fairness, due process, and equal justice under law, which the Supreme Court has championed over many years, are not mere abstractions; they are the bedrock of our legal system and the guarantor of individual liberty.
The Benjamin Allen case, as described, represents a profound challenge to these principles, demanding a resolute and unwavering commitment to truth, justice, and systemic reform.
Failure to act decisively will not only perpetuate a grave injustice in this specific case but will further erode public trust in the very foundations of our legal system.
The pursuit of justice demands nothing less than a complete and transparent reckoning with the systemic failures in this disturbing report.
Recommendations:
Dismissal with Prejudice
Under NCGS §15A-954(a)(4), dismissal is warranted due to the irreparable harm caused by prosecutorial misconduct, destruction of evidence, and lack of essential defense resources.
Disciplinary Action Against ADA  
File a formal disciplinary complaint in accordance with Rule 3.8 of the ABA Model Rules, outlining the ADA’s misrepresentation, intimidation, and suppression of exculpatory evidence.
§1983)  
A civil rights lawsuit should be drafted to address malicious prosecution, violations of the Fourth Amendment (lack of probable cause), and systemic due process violations under the Fourteenth Amendment.
The identified defendants include investigative officials whose misconduct surpassed prosecutorial immunity.
This extensive background implies:
A thorough understanding of the legal processes surrounding arrests, probable cause, documentation, and procedural safeguards.
A heightened expectation for meticulous documentation and procedural accuracy in investigations.
Awareness of the constitutional implications and procedural requirements when detaining a suspect without a warrant.
This implies that the defendant was detained or arrested based on probable cause prior to any formal judicial review.
The following is a breakdown and commentary on text messages sent by the defendant to Steve Happel while he was sitting in the Sheriff’s office.
Ben Allen: Might need bail
	            Don’t know yet
	            He said he was going to work something for me
Steve Happel: What does that mean
Ben Allen: To release me without it
                   They still have to file the charges
                   Until they get the kit back
Steve Happel: They are charging you
Ben Allen: Yup.
"Might need bail / Don’t know yet":
The defendant’s reference to bail implies he believed he was in a situation where arrest or detention was possible.
Bail is generally associated with the need to secure release from custody, so this statement suggests that Allen felt he was already under some form of control or restriction by law enforcement.
This could suggest that the defendant was under the impression he was facing imminent arrest or charges but that some leniency might be negotiated.
"To release me without it / They still have to file the charges":
The defendant’s expectation of release without bail suggests that he felt in a pre-custodial or custodial phase where formal charges were anticipated.
The phrase “they still have to file the charges” shows the defendant believed charges were not only likely but a necessary step being awaited by law enforcement.
"Until they get the kit back":
This implies the defendant was aware of an ongoing investigation contingent on forensic evidence (presumably from a medical or assault kit), meaning he understood the decision to charge him formally depended on further evidence analysis.
Knowing about the investigation’s reliance on forensic results reinforces the state of detention or restricted freedom.
":
The defendant’s response that law enforcement “have to” charge him confirms that he perceived his arrest or charging as inevitable.
This shows an understanding of his status as one where law enforcement had no choice but to proceed with formal charges, further indicating he felt he was already effectively “detained” in a legal sense.
Implications for Perceived Detention
These statements demonstrate that the defendant felt legally restricted, if not physically detained, and believed he was facing imminent formal charges.
His language—discussing bail, release, and pending charges—strongly indicates he perceived himself in a pre-charging or custodial state, anticipating law enforcement actions based on the ongoing investigation.
What Probable Cause Means in Law Enforcement
Definition and Importance: Probable cause is a legal standard that requires a reasonable belief, based on factual evidence, that a person has committed a crime.
This standard is fundamental to Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable searches and seizures.
In the context of arrests, probable cause is a safeguard to prevent arbitrary detention by requiring officers to base arrests on solid evidence rather than suspicion alone.
Constitutional Context: Under the Fourth Amendment, citizens are protected from unlawful arrests, which include arrests made without a reasonable basis.
Probable cause forms the threshold that must be met before depriving an individual of liberty, serving as a check on law enforcement power to ensure that any interference with personal freedom is legally justified.
Probable Cause Documentation as a Procedural Safeguard
Documentation as Evidence of Legitimacy: Documenting probable cause is crucial in establishing the legitimacy of an arrest.
It provides a written record for the court, the suspect, and the public to understand the factual basis of the detention.
This documentation is essential because it allows for judicial review, where a judge or magistrate can evaluate the lawfulness of the arrest.
Written Record and Chain of Justification: Probable cause documentation is typically written in an affidavit or report form and is presented to a magistrate or judge when requesting an arrest warrant.
This ensures a “chain of justification,” showing a clear, recorded rationale behind the arrest that can be reviewed, scrutinized, or contested in court if necessary.
Implications of Not Documenting Probable Cause
Impact on Judicial Review: In the absence of probable cause documentation, there is no record for a judge or magistrate to assess the validity of the detention.
Judicial review is a cornerstone of the legal process; without documentation, the judicial system is forced to rely solely on the officer’s word, undermining transparency and accountability.
For the defendant, this absence meant that no written probable cause statement was available for the court to verify the legal grounds of his detention.
Potential Constitutional Concerns: A failure to document probable cause can lead to constitutional concerns, as it challenges the transparency and legitimacy of an arrest.
Such a challenge could result in a motion to suppress evidence gathered following the arrest, potentially weakening the prosecution’s case.
Consequences in Criminal Proceedings
Evidentiary Issues: Lack of probable cause documentation can lead to evidentiary challenges.
For instance, evidence obtained following an arrest lacking documented probable cause might be ruled inadmissible, as it may be considered “fruit of the poisonous tree.” This doctrine holds that evidence derived from an unlawful act (like an arrest without proper probable cause) is tainted and, therefore, inadmissible in court.
Any deviation can lead to credibility concerns.
Magistrate Role: When a suspect is arrested without a warrant, it is standard to bring them before a magistrate or judge promptly.
The magistrate’s role is to review the basis for the arrest, assess probable cause, and ensure that the detention is lawful and supported by sufficient evidence.
The probable cause for an arrest without a warrant should be in writing.
This discrepancy is significant because:
Clarity on Legal Procedure: For someone with his background, not addressing the specific procedure followed (i.e., no formal warrant)  is a choice to simplify the description of the arrest process, leaving out details of how he justified probable cause to the magistrate.
This gap in his account demands scrutiny regarding the justification and documentation of probable cause that led directly to the defendant’s immediate detention.
The evasive testimony and the magistrate’s after-the-fact approval without review raise questions about the legitimacy of the arrest and the adherence to constitutional standards for lawful detention
Case Law and Legal Standards on Probable Cause Documentation
Relevant Case Law: Courts have consistently held that probable cause must be properly established and documented to justify arrests.
For example:
Dunaway v. New York (1979): This case established that even brief detentions require probable cause, emphasizing the need for documentation to protect against unlawful seizures.
Gerstein v. Pugh (1975): The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that a judicial determination of probable cause is required for any detention that continues beyond a very short period.
Without documented probable cause, a detention could be considered unlawful.
Without a written record, the detention process lacks the transparency needed to ensure compliance with these legal standards, raising questions about the arrest's validity.
Departmental Standards and Expected Protocol for Documenting Probable Cause
Standard Police Protocols: Law enforcement agencies typically mandate written documentation of probable cause when arresting a suspect without a warrant.
Officers generally complete a probable cause affidavit, which provides an official record that outlines the factual basis for the arrest, allowing for transparency and oversight.
His decision not to document probable cause could reflect an intentional deviation from standard protocol, as he would understand that documentation is integral to maintaining the legal integrity of an arrest.
If successful, this motion could exclude key evidence, weakening the prosecution’s case.
This omission:
Undermines the legitimacy of the arrest and creates grounds for a constitutional challenge.
Could lead to suppression of evidence due to potential Fourth Amendment violations.
The lack of probable cause documentation is not only a deviation from standard practice but could have substantial repercussions on the case's legal standing.
I’ll detail the legal significance of this type of order, examine its procedural implications, and highlight potential issues arising from the magistrate’s approval without a warrant.
The Magistrate’s Retrospective Order and Its Legal Implications
The Role of a Magistrate in the Arrest Process
Purpose of Judicial Review: A magistrate serves as an independent judicial authority who reviews law enforcement’s request for an arrest warrant to ensure it meets the probable cause requirement.
This check helps safeguard citizens’ rights by ensuring that law enforcement’s decision to detain an individual is based on adequate legal grounds, not merely on suspicion or an officer’s discretion.
Typical Warrant Process: In most cases, when law enforcement presents evidence of probable cause to a magistrate, the magistrate issues a formal arrest warrant.
This document then authorizes the arrest, ensuring that any subsequent detention aligns with constitutional standards.
What the Retrospective Order Indicates in This Case
Approval of an Existing Detention: In this case, rather than issuing an arrest warrant, the magistrate issued an order justifying that Allen’s “detention is justified because there is probable cause.” This language suggests that Allen was already in custody when the magistrate reviewed the circumstances, prompting the magistrate to approve the detention retroactively rather than authorize it prospectively.
Implication of Warrantless Detention: The wording “arrested without a warrant” implies that Allen was already detained before any formal judicial review.
This is an unusual legal approach and differs substantially from standard warrant issuance, which would typically involve documentation and review prior to custody.
Legal Standards for Warrantless Detentions
Fourth Amendment Protections: The Fourth Amendment guarantees citizens’ rights to freedom from unreasonable seizures, which include warrantless arrests.
Warrantless detentions are permitted only under exigent circumstances or when law enforcement directly witnesses a crime.
In cases lacking these elements, law enforcement generally needs either a warrant or immediate judicial approval post-detention.
Case Law Supporting Prompt Judicial Review:
County of Riverside v. McLaughlin (1991): This case established that individuals arrested without a warrant must be brought before a judicial officer within 48 hours to determine probable cause.
The ruling emphasized the need for prompt review to avoid unlawful detention and protect constitutional rights.
Gerstein v. Pugh (1975): The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that prolonged detention without judicial oversight violates the Fourth Amendment.
Gerstein requires judicial determination of probable cause for any detention beyond a brief period, stressing the importance of prompt review.
Given that Allen’s detention was justified retrospectively rather than through prospective judicial approval, this procedure likely circumvents the protections upheld by these cases.
Concerns with the Magistrate’s Retrospective Approval
Lack of Pre-Detention Review: Normally, an officer presents probable cause to the magistrate, who assesses whether the evidence justifies a warrant before any detention takes place.
This weakens the legal foundation for the detention, as verbal explanations lack the accountability and reviewability of formal documentation.
Potential Constitutional Issues: The retrospective approval order, while providing a semblance of legality, may still fall short constitutionally, as the delay in judicial review could be argued as infringing upon Allen’s Fourth Amendment rights.
Without a pre-detention review or written probable cause documentation, the arrest could be subject to challenge for failing to meet the standards set by McLaughlin and Gerstein.
Procedural Implications of the Retrospective Order
Deviation from Standard Arrest Protocols: This retrospective order represents a deviation from routine law enforcement practices.
Typically, law enforcement either presents probable cause for an arrest warrant before taking a person into custody or, if an individual is detained first due to urgent circumstances, promptly brings the detainee before a magistrate with documented evidence.
Why This Approach Is Problematic: The magistrate’s order to justify an already-completed detention disrupts the intended sequence of lawful arrest processes.
In such a scenario, a magistrate’s retrospective approval could imply a less rigorous assessment of probable cause, as it lacks the immediate review and evidence scrutiny typically required before custody.
Potential Legal Challenges and Vulnerabilities
Challenge of Unlawful Detention: Allen’s defense could argue that the arrest was unlawful due to the lack of a warrant and the retrospective nature of the magistrate’s order.
The absence of a standard probable cause assessment prior to custody weakens the detention’s legal validity, potentially supporting a motion for release or dismissal.
Fruit of the Poisonous Tree Doctrine: If the initial detention is deemed unlawful due to procedural irregularities, the defense may move to exclude any evidence collected following the arrest.
The “fruit of the poisonous tree” doctrine allows courts to suppress evidence obtained from illegal actions, meaning evidence gathered after Allen’s detention might be inadmissible if the detention process itself is found to be flawed.
Potential for Civil Rights Violation Claims: If the arrest and detention are deemed to have violated Fourth Amendment protections, Allen could pursue civil action against the department or involved officers, claiming an infringement of his constitutional rights through unlawful seizure and detention.
Comparing Standard Warrant Processes to This Retrospective Order
Standard Procedure: In a typical arrest, officers present documented probable cause to the magistrate, who then issues an arrest warrant.
This warrant establishes legality before custody and is based on a thorough, documented review of the facts.
This process could be seen as circumventing the usual checks and balances meant to prevent arbitrary or unjustified detentions.
Summary of Key Points
The magistrate’s retrospective order in this case diverges from standard arrest protocols, potentially compromising the legality of Allen’s detention:
The usual pre-detention review was bypassed, and probable cause was effectively determined after Allen was already in custody, which goes against established legal standards.
This approach may expose the case to legal challenges, including suppression of evidence and potential constitutional claims, as the retrospective approval does not align with Fourth Amendment protections or typical arrest processes.
This retrospective order serves as an after-the-fact justification for detention, yet its lack of pre-detention review and documentation raises significant procedural and constitutional concerns.
Significance of Custody Timing in Criminal Procedure
Importance of Clear Testimony: In criminal proceedings, officers are expected to provide clear and direct testimony regarding the timeline of events, especially concerning when a suspect is detained.
The timing of custody is critical, as it affects a suspect’s Fourth Amendment rights, which protect against unlawful detention.
Due Process and Accountability: Knowing when a suspect is officially in custody establishes accountability.
Clear testimony regarding custody timing helps the court evaluate the lawfulness of the detention and confirms whether procedural safeguards, like Miranda rights and probable cause, were properly adhered to.
Officers at his level of experience are expected to recognize the importance of clear testimony and adherence to standard procedures, particularly on issues like custody timing, which are critical to lawful detention.
For an experienced officer, vague testimony can indicate an attempt to minimize scrutiny or avoid exposing procedural flaws, which could suggest awareness that his handling of custody was irregular.
Law enforcement officers occasionally avoid admitting procedural irregularities if they fear it could lead to evidence suppression or diminish the credibility of the investigation.
For a seasoned officer, vague responses on key issues can suggest an attempt to mislead or obscure procedural flaws.
Risk of Undermining Entire Testimony: Once an officer’s credibility is questioned, it can have a “spillover” effect, casting doubt on all aspects of their testimony.
Legal Precedent on Witness Credibility: Courts have long held that an officer’s credibility is foundational to their testimony.
For example, in Napue v. Illinois (1959), the U.S. Supreme Court emphasized the importance of truthful testimony, noting that credibility issues can materially affect the trial’s outcome.
This could support a defense argument that the arrest lacked transparency and procedural integrity, bolstering claims that due process was violated.
Comparison to Standard Testimonial Expectations
Expected Transparency in Law Enforcement Testimony: Officers are typically expected to provide transparent, factual answers under oath.
When asked about procedural details like custody timing, clear and direct responses help maintain the integrity of the investigation and reinforce trust in law enforcement practices.
Legal Consequences of Evasive Testimony
Credibility and Impeachment Risks: In legal proceedings, evasive testimony from a law enforcement officer can be grounds for impeachment, allowing the defense to question the officer’s credibility.

Failure to Bring Allen Before a Magistrate
Importance of Judicial Review in Warrantless Detentions
Legal Requirement for Prompt Judicial Review: When a suspect is arrested without a warrant, it is a legal requirement to bring them before a magistrate “without unnecessary delay.” Judicial review allows a magistrate to independently assess whether there was probable cause for the detention, providing a crucial check on law enforcement’s authority.
This requirement is fundamental to upholding Fourth Amendment protections, ensuring that individuals are not subject to arbitrary or extended detention without judicial oversight.
Role of Judicial Review in Due Process: Judicial review serves as an essential due process safeguard.
Without it, suspects are at risk of prolonged detention based solely on an officer’s discretion, which can lead to unlawful detention if probable cause is insufficient.
A magistrate’s involvement provides an impartial assessment to confirm that the detention is based on lawful grounds.
Legal Precedents Mandating Timely Appearance Before a Magistrate
County of Riverside v. McLaughlin (1991): This case established that individuals arrested without a warrant must be brought before a judicial officer within 48 hours.
Delays beyond this period are presumed to violate the Fourth Amendment unless law enforcement can provide a compelling reason.
McLaughlin emphasized that timely judicial review is crucial to prevent unlawful detention and to validate the probable cause justifying the arrest.
Gerstein v. Pugh (1975): The Supreme Court ruled that a judicial determination of probable cause is required for any detention beyond a brief period.
Gerstein set the precedent that probable cause must be evaluated promptly by a judge or magistrate to meet constitutional standards.
This case laid the foundation for ensuring that law enforcement detentions are subject to prompt judicial oversight, reinforcing that extended detention without review constitutes an infringement on rights.
This procedural gap could be considered a violation of Allen’s Fourth Amendment rights, as it bypasses the required judicial oversight and could be grounds for challenging the lawfulness of the detention.
His experience implies a clear understanding of both the legal standards and the potential consequences of failing to secure judicial review.
Procedural Expectation in Law Enforcement: For an experienced officer, failing to bring a detainee before a magistrate is not only unusual but also raises questions about adherence to established protocols.
This setup weakens the legitimacy of the detention and could support a defense claim that Allen’s rights were violated.
Suppression of Evidence Obtained Post-Detention: If Allen’s detention is found to lack judicial oversight, the defense could argue for the suppression of any evidence gathered following the detention under the “fruit of the poisonous tree” doctrine.
This doctrine holds that evidence derived from an illegal act—such as an unlawful detention—should be excluded from trial.
The lack of judicial review weakens the foundation of Allen’s detention, potentially jeopardizing all evidence obtained thereafter.
Procedural Weaknesses in Judicial Review Retrospective: The retrospective order from the magistrate stating that Allen was detained “without a warrant” does not remedy the lack of pre-detention judicial oversight.
Such an order may provide a semblance of legality, but without a prompt pre-detention review, it lacks the constitutional backing necessary for lawful detention.
This procedural shortcut could be viewed as an infringement of Allen’s right to prompt judicial evaluation.
Implications for Allen’s Fourth Amendment Rights
Violation of Constitutional Standards: The absence of prompt judicial review in Allen’s case may amount to a Fourth Amendment violation.
Such a deviation from protocol undermines due process and could be viewed as an unconstitutional deprivation of liberty.
Basis for Defense Challenges: The defense could argue that Allen’s Fourth Amendment rights were infringed upon due to the lack of judicial review.
This challenge could be based on case law precedent, particularly McLaughlin and Gerstein, which both emphasize the importance of prompt judicial review.
The lack of adherence to these standards could serve as the basis for seeking dismissal of charges or suppression of evidence.
This process allows a judge to review the facts, ensuring the detention is justified.
Any delay in this review could lead to constitutional challenges.
Even if he believed the evidence was strong, an experienced officer would understand that probable cause must be reviewed by a magistrate to protect against claims of unlawful detention.
Potential Legal Ramifications for the Case
Impact on Detention Legitimacy: Failing to provide Allen with prompt judicial review weakens the foundation of his detention.
In court, the defense could argue that any detention without judicial oversight is inherently flawed, raising serious due process concerns.
Challenge to the Prosecution’s Evidence: Without judicial review, the prosecution’s evidence may be vulnerable to suppression if the court finds Allen’s detention violated constitutional standards.
Any evidence obtained post-detention could be excluded if the defense successfully argues that the lack of judicial review made the detention unlawful.
Possible Basis for Civil Litigation: If the detention is ruled unlawful, Allen could have grounds to file a civil rights lawsuit against the department or the officers involved.
Failure to follow due process by not securing judicial oversight before detention is a constitutional breach that could support claims of rights violations, resulting in liability for the agency or individual officers.
Regardless, his actions indicate a significant departure from established protocols and a possible attempt to streamline the detention process by minimizing procedural safeguards.
The court might view these actions as indicative of a pattern of procedural deviations, casting doubt on the integrity of his investigation and his adherence to lawful practices.
Collection and Management of Physical Evidence
The Role of Physical Evidence in Criminal Investigations
Foundation of Evidence-Based Investigations: Physical evidence, such as DNA samples, personal items, and video footage, is often critical in substantiating or refuting claims within an investigation.
For physical evidence to hold up in court, it must be collected, documented, and preserved according to strict protocols to maintain its integrity.
This is especially important in cases like Allen’s, where the physical evidence could either validate the alleged victim’s story or provide exculpatory information.
Obtaining Allen’s consent for the DNA sample is significant, as it suggests procedural adherence in terms of respecting Allen’s rights at the time of collection.
However, it is worth noting that the integrity of this evidence could still be questioned if the legality of Allen’s detention comes under scrutiny, as any evidence derived from an unlawful detention could be challenged.
The warrant-supported seizure and documentation add a layer of procedural integrity to the handling of these items.
Chain of Custody and Documentation Standards
Importance of Chain of Custody: Maintaining a documented chain of custody is crucial for every piece of evidence collected in a case.
This process ensures that evidence has been accounted for from the moment of collection through every step of handling and analysis.
Each handler or examiner must be recorded, and any changes to the evidence should be documented to avoid claims of tampering or contamination.
Expected Documentation Procedures: In a standard investigation, each item of evidence should be recorded with a detailed description, time, date, location of collection, and the name of the collecting officer.
Missing links in the chain of custody can render evidence inadmissible if the court deems the handling insufficiently reliable.
Evidence left unsecured can be subject to environmental factors, tampering, or alteration, which can compromise its integrity.
Potential Legal Ramifications of Procedural Issues in Evidence Handling
Grounds for Suppression of Evidence: If the defense can establish that the chain of custody was broken or that evidence was mishandled, they may argue for suppression under the “fruit of the poisonous tree” doctrine.
This doctrine holds that evidence obtained through unlawful actions (such as mishandling or improper collection) is tainted and should be excluded from trial.
Impact on Trial and Burden of Proof: Physical evidence, particularly DNA, can be powerful in affirming or disproving allegations.
If key evidence like the DNA sample or surveillance footage is suppressed due to handling issues, it could weaken the prosecution’s case.
In criminal cases, the prosecution must meet the burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt, and any evidence deficiencies could make it more challenging to meet this standard.
Officers are trained to avoid delays in securing evidence and to maintain a rigorous chain of custody.
While he followed protocol in obtaining a warrant for certain items, his handling of chain of custody documentation for all items appears incomplete.
This argument would be especially compelling if physical evidence forms a significant part of the prosecution’s case.
This could influence the jury to view the prosecution’s evidence with skepticism, especially if key pieces of evidence are called into question.

Now, moving on to the final section: "Probable Cause and the Arrest Process".
Probable Cause and the Arrest Process
The Role of Probable Cause in Lawful Arrests
Definition of Probable Cause: Probable cause is a reasonable basis for believing that a person has committed a crime, established through facts and evidence rather than speculation or personal judgment.
Probable cause acts as a safeguard against arbitrary detention, ensuring that arrests are based on verifiable information and protecting citizens’ Fourth Amendment rights.
Legal Importance of Probable Cause: The U.S. Constitution’s Fourth Amendment establishes that arrests should only be conducted when probable cause exists, either through an officer’s direct observations, reliable witness accounts, or other corroborative evidence.
For an arrest to be lawful, the evidence supporting probable cause must be substantive enough to withstand judicial review, typically documented in detail within an affidavit.
Typically, officers create a written record or affidavit outlining the basis for probable cause, especially in cases where the arrest is made without a warrant.
This document serves as a transparent and verifiable record for judicial review.
Legal Standards and Precedents on Probable Cause Documentation
Case Law Supporting Written Documentation:
Gerstein v. Pugh (1975): This case emphasized that the Constitution requires a prompt judicial determination of probable cause for any significant detention.
Without written documentation, the court lacks a reliable basis for validating the lawfulness of detention.
Illinois v. Gates (1983): This case addressed the “totality of the circumstances” in establishing probable cause, but it also emphasized the importance of having a documented record that a judge can review, ensuring that the arrest was based on objective facts rather than subjective judgment.
If there is no verifiable record of probable cause, the arrest may lack the constitutionally required basis, which could lead to significant procedural challenges.
Officers in his position are not only expected to know these requirements but are often responsible for teaching them, making his omission more notable.
Adherence to Probable Cause Standards: Law enforcement officers are trained to document probable cause, especially in cases where the arrest occurs without a warrant.
Implications of Probable Cause Issues on Allen’s Arrest
Risk of Unlawful Detention: Without documented probable cause, Allen’s detention could be seen as lacking a legal foundation.
If the arrest cannot be shown to have met the probable cause threshold, the detention could be deemed unlawful, infringing upon Allen’s Fourth Amendment rights.
This would make all subsequent evidence potentially vulnerable to suppression.
Fruit of the Poisonous Tree Doctrine: If Allen’s detention is found unlawful due to insufficient probable cause documentation, the defense may invoke the “fruit of the poisonous tree” doctrine.
This doctrine holds that any evidence obtained from an illegal detention is tainted and should be excluded from the trial.
In this case, the absence of documented probable cause weakens the arrest and could endanger evidence collected thereafter.
Defense Challenge Based on Constitutional Grounds: Allen’s defense could argue that his detention violated constitutional protections due to the lack of written probable cause.
How the Retrospective Order Affects Probable Cause
The Magistrate’s Retrospective Justification: The magistrate’s order indicated that Allen was arrested “without a warrant” and that the detention was justified by probable cause.
This order retrospectively legitimizes the detention but does not provide the same legal foundation as a pre-detention warrant based on documented probable cause.
Procedural and Legal Limitations of Retrospective Orders: Retrospective approval can only serve as a stopgap and does not replace the necessity of documented probable cause.
By approving the arrest after it had occurred without a formal written record, the magistrate’s order could still be subject to challenge, especially if the court finds that it circumvented standard judicial review protocols.
An officer’s credibility is central to the prosecution’s case, and any appearance of procedural shortcuts or omissions can erode confidence in the investigation’s integrity.
This document would undergo judicial review before or immediately after custody, ensuring transparency and legal compliance.
For an experienced officer, this is an unusual and legally vulnerable approach, suggesting either an intentional bypass of protocol or an assumption that his judgment would suffice.
Defense Strategy and Possible Legal Challenges
Motion to Suppress Evidence: The defense could file a motion to suppress evidence obtained post-detention, arguing that the lack of documented probable cause invalidates the arrest.
If the court agrees, key evidence collected following Allen’s detention could be excluded, weakening the prosecution’s case.
Challenge to the Retrospective Approval’s Validity: By emphasizing the lack of pre-detention documentation, the defense may argue that the magistrate’s retrospective approval fails to meet constitutional standards, citing cases like Gerstein and McLaughlin that require prompt judicial review based on documented evidence.
The magistrate’s retrospective approval does not fully replace the need for pre-detention documentation, as it bypasses the usual review processes and lacks the rigor of a documented affidavit.
If you have further questions or would like to explore additional aspects of this case, feel free to let me know.
This could undermine the prosecution’s argument that the physical evidence conclusively supports their case.
If Allen’s detention occurred before formal judicial review, this might constitute an unlawful detention, supporting a suppression motion.
Legal Vulnerabilities: The lack of probable cause documentation, ambiguous custody timing, and incomplete evidence corroboration might provide grounds for suppression motions or credibility challenges that could weaken the prosecution’s case.
Defense Leverage: Cruz’s questioning established potential areas of procedural and factual ambiguity, which the defense could further explore to cast doubt on the investigation’s integrity.
Inaccuracies and Narrative Additions in the Search Warrant Affidavit
Importance of Accuracy in Probable Cause Affidavits:
A probable cause affidavit for a search warrant must be precise and based solely on factual evidence.
This document is presented to a judge or magistrate to demonstrate the need to search a particular location based on evidence directly connected to the case.
Probable cause affidavits are foundational to the integrity of the judicial review process, as they allow judges to make impartial decisions based on verified information.
Probable cause affidavits are held to high standards of truthfulness and accuracy.
Fabrications or exaggerations in affidavits not only jeopardize the specific search warrant but can also reflect poorly on the integrity of the entire investigation, potentially leading to claims of investigational bias or misconduct.
Adding unverified narratives to a probable cause affidavit can also open the door to suppression motions.
If the defense can demonstrate that the affidavit contained embellishments or falsehoods, they could argue that the search warrant was issued on improper grounds.
Potential Legal Consequences:
Suppression of Evidence: If the court finds that the search warrant was based on an inaccurate affidavit, any evidence obtained from the search could be suppressed.
This doctrine, known as the “fruit of the poisonous tree,” applies when initial misconduct (e.g., false information in an affidavit) taints subsequent evidence collection.
Absence of a Probable Cause Affidavit for Allen’s Arrest
Standard Legal Procedure for Arrests:
In typical legal practice, a probable cause affidavit is required when an officer seeks to arrest someone without a warrant.
This document provides an official, written record of the factual basis for the arrest, ensuring that the detention is lawful and based on verified evidence.
Probable cause affidavits for arrest are essential for accountability.
They offer a clear, documented rationale for the arrest, which allows for judicial review, protects the detainee’s rights, and establishes transparency in the arrest process.
This absence suggests a potential violation of Allen’s Fourth Amendment rights, as the arrest lacks the formal documentation needed to justify the detention.
In court, this omission could be interpreted as a procedural oversight or a deliberate attempt to bypass judicial oversight.
Judicial review is a crucial step in ensuring that arrests are based on lawful grounds, and bypassing this step undermines the legality of the arrest.
In cases like this, where no probable cause affidavit was filed, the defense has a strong basis to argue that Allen’s detention was arbitrary or unlawful.
Discrepancies between testimony and witness statements can impact the court’s perception of the officer’s objectivity and trustworthiness.
For an experienced officer, these omissions and additions suggest either a misunderstanding of protocol or a deliberate decision to bypass steps to secure judicial approval.
Any evidence tied to the search warrant or arrest could be at risk for suppression, as the court may view the inaccuracies and omissions as compromising the evidence’s legitimacy.
The potential for civil liability also exists.
This could lead to challenges in court if the defense argues that the affidavit contained false or misleading information.
Lack of Probable Cause Affidavit for Arrest: The absence of a probable cause affidavit for Allen’s arrest represents a major procedural gap, undermining the lawfulness of the arrest and potentially constituting a Fourth Amendment violation.
These actions risk his credibility and could weaken the prosecution’s case, especially if the defense successfully argues that his investigation was biased or incomplete.
If the defense is able to convince the court that these omissions indicate investigative misconduct or negligence, it could have serious implications for the evidence’s admissibility and the trial’s outcome.
Conflict of Interest and Ethical Standards
Ethical Obligation to Disclose Relationships:
Law enforcement officers have a professional obligation to disclose any personal or familial relationships that could be perceived as a conflict of interest, particularly in cases where the relationship might affect their objectivity.
Disclosure is essential in ensuring transparency, maintaining public trust, and avoiding potential biases in the investigation.
Departmental Protocol and Conflict of Interest:
Most law enforcement agencies have protocols requiring officers to step back from investigations involving family members or close personal connections.
This helps prevent any appearance of partiality and preserves the credibility of both the officer and the investigation.
In cases where a conflict of interest is not disclosed, courts may question the admissibility of evidence if it appears that the investigator’s judgment was compromised.
This could weaken the prosecution’s case, especially if the undisclosed relationship played a role in shaping the investigation’s direction.
Possibility of Investigator Recusal:
In situations where an investigator has a close relationship with a witness, their involvement could be grounds for recusal.
This lack of recusal could be portrayed as an oversight that ultimately compromised the case’s fairness.
Courts are cautious about cases where key investigators have conflicts of interest, as this can impede the defendant’s right to a fair trial.
If the trial proceeds with the undisclosed relationship unchallenged but is later discovered, it could also serve as grounds for an appeal.
Legal Consequences: The non-disclosure could lead to challenges against the admissibility of evidence, grounds for suppression, and potentially even a mistrial or appeal based on the defendant’s right to a fair trial.
Prosecution Challenges: The prosecution may face an uphill battle in mitigating the perceived bias, as the undisclosed relationship undermines the perception of a fair and impartial investigation.
Impact on Probable Cause and Arrest Justification: Video footage should have been reviewed at the outset to substantiate claims in the probable cause affidavit.
Judicial and Procedural Concerns: Courts expect that key evidence, especially objective video evidence, is reviewed and incorporated into probable cause determinations.
Judicial and Defense Implications: Courts require that affidavits be accurate and based on reliable information.
This weakens the affidavit’s credibility and opens the door to legal challenges regarding the validity of probable cause.
What rules of investigation does it violate?
ChatGPT said:
In a thorough investigation, verifying the ownership and origin of key evidence, especially items like clothing found at a suspect’s residence, is standard protocol.
Let’s examine why this oversight is problematic, what investigative standards it potentially violates, and why the prosecution might have sought to verify the pants if the case was handled meticulously.
Importance of Verifying Key Evidence
Standard Investigative Practice: In cases involving physical evidence found at a suspect's location, it is essential to verify the evidence's relevance to the alleged crime.
Authentication for Admissibility: In court, evidence must be authenticated to establish its connection to the case.
Rules of Investigation Potentially Violated
Chain of Custody and Documentation Standards: In standard investigative protocol, items with potential evidentiary value—like clothing left at a crime scene—should be processed, documented, and, if necessary, analyzed in a lab.
Evidence Relevance and Reliability Standards:
Fundamental Relevance: Investigators are expected to confirm the relevance of evidence to the case before presenting it.
Reliability in Evidence Collection: For physical evidence to be reliable, investigators must establish its origin.
Investigative best practices would call for verifying who owned the pants, how they arrived at the residence, and when.
Procedural Deviations in Evidence Handling: Standard investigative practice would involve submitting the pants for forensic analysis to confirm details such as DNA, fiber, or material traces that might corroborate or contradict Deal’s account.
Why the Prosecution Should Have Sought Verification
Implications for Case Strength and Jury Perception: Verification of the pants’ ownership would strengthen the prosecution’s case by objectively linking the alleged victim to the suspect’s residence, adding credence to her statements.
Risk of Undermining Credibility: Leaving the pants unverified opens the door for the defense to argue that there is no proof they belong to Deal, undermining the relevance of the pants as evidence.
A diligent prosecutor would typically insist on verification to avoid this argument and reinforce the case’s factual basis.
Ethical Obligation to Pursue Objective Truth: Prosecutors have an ethical duty to ensure evidence is reliable and objectively tied to the case.
This argument could create reasonable doubt regarding the thoroughness of the case.
Summary of Key Points
Investigative and Evidentiary Standards: Verifying that the pants belonged to the alleged victim is a fundamental step in establishing relevance and reliability in physical evidence.
Failure to do so may violate best practices in investigative and evidentiary handling.
Prosecutorial Oversight: The prosecution should have insisted on verification to strengthen the case and ensure all evidence presented was both credible and corroborated by forensic analysis.
Defense Opportunities: The defense could capitalize on the lack of verification to argue that the investigation lacked diligence and relied on unsupported assumptions, potentially undermining the credibility of the pants as evidence and casting doubt on the thoroughness of the investigation.
○ Improper maintenance of the chain of custody.
○ Neglecting to administer Miranda rights upon arrest.
Taken together, they suggest a pattern of incomplete investigation, unprofessional conduct, and procedural lapses, which could seriously undermine the prosecution’s case.
Properly securing and documenting a crime scene is fundamental to preserving the integrity of evidence and avoiding contamination or loss of critical details.
Procedural Violations and Potential Impact:
Failure to secure the crime scene and adequately collect evidence can be grounds for the defense to argue that the investigation was incomplete, potentially resulting in exculpatory evidence being missed or compromised.
Full identification of all witnesses is crucial to ensure that statements are accurately attributed and that the investigation is complete.
Comprehensive witness interviews help ensure that all relevant perspectives are included, supporting an objective and well-rounded case narrative.
Improper Chain of Custody and Evidence Verification
Issues with Chain of Custody:
Improper maintenance of the chain of custody can make it difficult to verify that evidence remains unaltered from collection to presentation in court.
This is especially critical when dealing with items like clothing or personal belongings, which could be subject to contamination or misidentification.
Without verifying ownership and maintaining an intact chain of custody, the defense can challenge the evidence’s admissibility, arguing that it is unreliable and potentially irrelevant.
In cases where chain of custody is not strictly followed, courts may rule that evidence is inadmissible, weakening the prosecution’s case.
Miranda rights are required to ensure that suspects understand their rights to remain silent and to have legal representation during questioning.
Potential Consequences for Allen’s Statements:
Statements made by Allen without Miranda warnings could be subject to suppression if the court finds they were obtained in a custodial setting.
Impact on Evidence Reliability: The improper chain of custody, lack of verification, and inadequate evidence collection compromise the reliability and admissibility of the evidence.
By exposing these procedural shortcomings, the defense could undermine the credibility of the prosecution’s evidence and suggest that the case lacks a reliable factual foundation.
North Carolina’s Mandatory Reporting Requirements
Legal Requirement for Reporting:
In North Carolina, hospitals are legally obligated to report cases of suspected assault, abuse, or other injuries that may involve criminal activity.
Failure to report such cases to law enforcement can result in felony charges against the hospital staff or administration.
This mandatory reporting requirement ensures that law enforcement is promptly notified in cases involving potential crimes, thereby enabling immediate investigation and evidence preservation.
If CCH failed to report the incident to law enforcement, or if they did report but records are now being withheld, this could represent a serious breach of legal obligations and raise questions about collusion or mishandling.
Legal Consequences for Non-Compliance:
If it is found that CCH did not fulfill its reporting obligation, it could be subject to legal consequences, including potential felony charges.
Furthermore, any failure to comply with reporting laws could raise suspicion that hospital staff, law enforcement, or both may have had a reason to avoid documenting this case properly.
Implications for Law Enforcement Involvement:
If law enforcement was contacted upon Deal’s arrival at CCH and a decision was made not to record or investigate the report at that time, it could suggest that a deal or informal arrangement was made to delay or avoid formal documentation.
Any indication that an arrangement was made between hospital staff and law enforcement to circumvent standard reporting protocols would be highly irregular and potentially unlawful, as it would imply a deliberate effort to delay or obscure initial investigatory actions.
Withholding these records could be seen as an attempt to obstruct justice if it is revealed that law enforcement or hospital staff sought to avoid initiating a formal investigation or to protect particular individuals involved.
Possibility of Collusion:
If there was a deliberate attempt to avoid creating a formal record of the incident, this could indicate collusion between hospital staff and law enforcement to keep the case off the books until a more convenient time.
Such collusion would be a serious breach of ethical and legal standards, as it would indicate that personal interests or relationships influenced official duties.
If it is found that an arrangement was made to postpone investigatory action, this could constitute obstruction of justice and have serious legal ramifications for all parties involved.
Implications for the Defense and Legal Strategy
Grounds for Defense Motions:
The defense could argue that any evidence from CCH or subsequent investigations is tainted by procedural misconduct.
The failure to release 911 records and other relevant documentation creates grounds for questioning the validity of the initial investigation, potentially supporting motions to suppress evidence based on the irregularities surrounding law enforcement’s involvement.
If it is proven that law enforcement or hospital staff delayed reporting or failed to comply with mandatory reporting laws, this could also bolster defense claims of bias or misconduct, further undermining the prosecution’s case.
If these records continue to be withheld, the defense could seek a subpoena to compel their release, arguing that these documents are essential to understanding the initial law enforcement response and any deviations from protocol.
Subpoenas could also be issued to obtain communications between CCH staff and law enforcement to determine whether any informal agreements or instructions were issued to delay or avoid formal documentation, which could be evidence of obstruction of justice.
Investigative Steps and Oversight
Review of CCH and Law Enforcement Protocols:
A review of both CCH’s reporting protocols and law enforcement’s response policies in such cases would be necessary to understand if any deviations occurred.
This review would involve examining hospital records to ensure they complied with state laws requiring mandatory reporting of potential assault cases.
Internal investigations within both CCH and the law enforcement department could be launched to assess whether reporting protocols were followed and if any misconduct or conflict of interest influenced the initial handling of the case.
Potential Involvement of External Oversight Bodies:
Given the nature of the allegations, external oversight bodies, such as the North Carolina Medical Board (for hospital compliance) and the State Bureau of Investigation (for law enforcement conduct), could be involved to review whether mandatory reporting requirements and investigative protocols were properly followed.
Summary of Key Points
Mandatory Reporting Non-Compliance: If CCH failed to report the incident as required by law, or if law enforcement responded but made an informal arrangement to delay or avoid documentation, this would indicate significant procedural and legal violations.
Defense Strategy for Discovery: The defense could pursue 911 and hospital records to uncover any unreported law enforcement involvement and potentially expose an obstruction of justice.
If records are withheld, the defense could request subpoenas and argue that these documents are critical to assessing the legality and integrity of the initial investigation.
Potential for External Oversight: Failure to follow mandatory reporting laws and procedural transparency requirements may prompt involvement from oversight agencies to ensure that CCH and law enforcement personnel adhered to ethical and legal standards in handling the case.
This was used as leverage, not law.
D. Discovery/Trial-Management Abuses
Patterned late disclosures (DNA, mental-health, relationships) impede defense preparation.
Continues to delay the trial, causing the defendant irreparable financial harm.
Instituted strategic delays degrading evidence and imposing hardship—paired with misrepresentation of the jury split (touting a 9–3 to justify retrial where the record reflected 12–0 on one count and 9–3 for acquittal on a lesser).
E. Probable-Cause Irregularities / Warrantless Arrest
Proceeded without a probable-cause affidavit; detective admitted no written account; chronology inconsistent with magistrate paperwork (order memorializing warrantless arrest vs. testimony about “obtaining a warrant”).
G. Judge-Shopping via Procedural Manipulation
Repeated continuances were used tactically to obtain a perceived favorable jurist, corroding the appearance of impartial adjudication.
H. Miranda/Right-to-Counsel Indifference
In open court, the ADA elicited—and adopted—a stance trivializing Miranda warnings (“you didn’t advise him of what we see on TV…right?” / “Right.

Benjamin Allen Case File: A Systemic Breakdown of Justice
Forward – Content Reference
This report on the Benjamin Allen case file uncovers a disturbing panorama of failures within the criminal justice system, demanding an urgent and thorough investigation.
The extensive misconduct and procedural violations detailed in this report are profoundly concerning, illustrating both isolated errors and a systemic failure of justice.
Failure to Establish Probable Cause:
The defendant was never brought before a magistrate, making this a per se violation of Fourth Amendment procedural due process under both federal and North Carolina law.
His failure to document probable cause before arrest, inconsistent statements under oath, and the magistrate’s acknowledgment of a warrantless arrest suggest a subversion of judicial safeguards meant to prevent arbitrary detention.
These actions expose the arrest to suppression on Fourth Amendment grounds and reflect a significant breach of the procedural integrity required of law enforcement under Gerstein v. Pugh, 420 U.S. 103 (1975).
This is not a mere oversight; it strikes at the heart of impartiality, a cornerstone of any legitimate investigation.
As Justice Louis Brandeis articulated in Olmstead v. United States, a landmark case on the Fourth Amendment and the right to privacy, "Decency, security, and liberty alike demand that government officials shall be subjected to the same rules of conduct that are commands to the citizen."
This directly violates the principle of due process, as the very foundation of the investigation becomes suspect.
This selective investigation echoes the concerns raised by Justice Black , consistently warning against shortcuts and biases in law enforcement that undermine individual liberties.
Crime Scene Neglect: The report meticulously documents the egregious failures in crime scene processing.
This is not a technicality but a fundamental failure to adhere to established investigative standards, as meticulously outlined in crime scene investigation protocols.
As Justice Holmes famously stated, "The life of the law has not been logic; it has been experience."
Lack of Authentication: The failure to authenticate crucial pieces of evidence, like the pants allegedly belonging to the accuser raise serious questions about the integrity and admissibility of evidence presented at trial.
Without a proper chain of custody and authentication, the evidentiary value of these items is severely compromised, undermining the foundation of the prosecution's narrative.
This is not merely a procedural oversight; it directly affects the reliability and trustworthiness of the evidence upon which a trial can be held.
This directly implicates Brady v. Maryland.
The cumulative effect of these false statements and omissions undermines the probable cause upon which the arrest and subsequent prosecution were predicated.
Prosecutorial Misconduct
The conduct of the Assistant District Attorney (ADA) detailed in this report is equally, if not more, alarming.
It reveals a pattern of behavior that suggests a conscious disregard for ethical obligations and due process actively compounding the investigative failures.
This is not aggressive advocacy, but outright deception intended to coerce a guilty plea under false pretenses.
In Miranda v. Arizona, a case that established the principle of the right to remain silent, Justice Warren emphasized the importance of protecting individuals against coercion within the legal system.
The ADA's actions violate this principle, exploit the defendant's vulnerability, and undermine the integrity of the plea-bargaining process, potentially leading to a wrongful conviction.
Withholding exculpatory evidence and failing to disclose critical material directly violate Brady obligations.
The cumulative effect of these actions systematically disadvantages the defense, undermining their ability to prepare a strong case and effectively challenge the prosecution's narrative.
This procedural manipulation directly infringes upon the defendant's Sixth Amendment right to effective counsel and a fair trial, highlighting the systemic issues in the case, where both the investigative and prosecutorial sides appear to be working against the defendant.
Discovery Violations: 
Procedural Abuse:  The egregious delay of thirty-seven continuances over four years is not merely inefficiency; it constitutes a deliberate abuse of the legal process and a blatant violation of the defendant's Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial.
Justice Brennan eloquently wrote in Klopfer v. North Carolina the right to a speedy trial is "as fundamental as any of the rights secured by the Sixth Amendment."
The prosecution's systematic delays, resulting in lost evidence, witness memory degradation, and profound emotional and financial hardship for the defendant, are inexcusable and further solidify the impression of a system actively working against the defendant, rather than impartially seeking justice.
Speedy Trial Violations:
Failure to Correct False Testimony: The report points out that the ADA repeatedly refused to correct known false testimony, directly contravening the precedent set in Napue v. Illinois.
Allowing perjured testimony to stand uncorrected is a fundamental breach of prosecutorial ethics and a violation of due process.
Furthermore, the alleged misuse of grand jury processes by introducing misleading evidence and false testimony undermines the integrity of this critical pre-trial stage.
These actions suggest a pattern of intentional manipulation of the legal system to secure an indictment and an attempt at a subsequent conviction, regardless of the veracity of the evidence.
Misuse of Grand Jury: 
Judge Shopping: The ADA intentionally manipulated procedural mechanisms—such as repeatedly requesting continuances—to secure a specific judge favorable to the prosecution, thereby undermining judicial impartiality and fairness.
This practice violates defendants' constitutional rights under the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses and the Sixth Amendment's right to a fair trial by compromising judicial neutrality, as established clearly in Caperton v. A.T. Massey Coal Co., Tumey v. Ohio, and Ward v. Village of Monroeville.
Failure to Investigate Critical Leads:
Procedural Omissions 
Brady Violations



III.
Rule:
Under Bordenkircher v. Hayes, 434 U.S. 357 (1978), while plea bargaining involves prosecutorial discretion, it cannot involve fraudulent inducement or deceit.
If a prosecutor offers a plea based on materially false evidence or interpretation, it undermines the voluntary nature of plea decisions.
Application:
The ADA’s admitted misunderstanding of forensic evidence and a retaliatory second grand jury indictment raise serious concerns about vindictive prosecution, which is prohibited by due process principles.
Revisiting the grand jury to increase charges after plea refusal invokes Blackledge v. Perry, 417 U.S. 21 (1974), suggesting presumptive vindictiveness.
Conclusion:
This clearly abuses prosecutorial discretion, amounting to coercive and misleading plea negotiation.
VIOLATION OF SPEEDY TRIAL RIGHTS
Claim:
There was an unjustified multi-year delay in bringing the case to trial, largely due to the ADA's failure to provide timely discovery.
Rule:
In Barker v. Wingo, 407 U.S. 514 (1972), the Court laid out a four-factor test to assess Speedy Trial violations:
Length of delay
Reason for delay
Defendant’s assertion of the right
Prejudice to the defendant
Negligence and administrative inertia, even without bad faith, weigh against the government, especially when delays are extended.
Reason: Negligence and deliberate delay (e.g., discovery during trial).
387 (1985), where a Speedy Trial violation was found due to repeated State negligence in indictment procedure.
Conclusion:
The ADA’s delay and discovery failures likely violated the Sixth Amendment and North Carolina constitutional rights to a speedy trial.
Rule:
Under Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963), prosecutors must disclose exculpatory or impeachment evidence.
Application:
The late and piecemeal disclosure—particularly when critical to the defense expert's analysis—prejudiced the defense’s ability to prepare and to challenge the state's claims, constituting suppression through delay.
Defense submitted evidence of perjury and false statements​.
Rule:
Presenting known perjured testimony violates due process (Napue v. Illinois, 360 U.S. 264 (1959)).
Even if the prosecution does not solicit perjury, its failure to correct it is unconstitutional.
Conclusion:
This element justifies a motion to disqualify and potentially a Napue claim for reversal or dismissal.
PATTERN OF RETALIATORY AND BAD-FAITH PROSECUTION
Claim:
The ADA retaliated for the exercise of constitutional rights (refusal of plea, filing of motions, insistence on trial) by increasing charges and proceeding despite mistrial with majority favoring acquittal.
Rule:
In United States v. Goodwin, 457 U.S. 368 (1982), the Court acknowledged the presumption of vindictiveness post-trial.
Blackledge reinforces that increased charges after invocation of trial rights are constitutionally suspect.
Application:
Here, the ADA increased charges and pursued a retrial despite a weak case and impeachment evidence, suggesting a retaliatory motive.
Conclusion:
The prosecution was likely undertaken in bad faith, tainted by vindictiveness.
VIOLATION OF ETHICAL STANDARDS 
(N.C. RULES OF PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT)
Violated Rules:
Rule 3.8 (Special Responsibilities of a Prosecutor): Includes timely disclosure of evidence, avoidance of prosecution without probable cause, and duty to seek justice.
Rule 8.4: Prohibits conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation.
Ineffective Assistance of Counsel
The report outlines a deeply concerning scenario of ineffective assistance of counsel, further stacking the odds against the defendant.
This inaction directly prejudiced the defendant's ability to challenge the prosecution's case and present a robust defense.
As Justice Marshall consistently emphasized, the right to counsel is not merely the right to have a lawyer but effective legal representation.
The reported failures suggest a profound deficiency in this critical constitutional guarantee.
Such a conflict could reasonably compromise the attorney's impartiality and willingness to attack the detective's investigation.
Furthermore, the reported refusal of defense counsel to file speedy trial motions, despite the egregious delays and the defendant's explicit requests, is a shocking abdication of their responsibility to protect their client's constitutional rights.
This inaction suggests gross incompetence or, more disturbingly, a potential complicity in the systemic failures that plagued this case.
Denial of Speedy Trial Claim: 
Loss of Phone Data and The defense firm's inexplicable loss of the defendant's phone and extracted data is a deeply troubling event.
While attributed to defense counsel, it underscores this case's systemic vulnerability to evidence loss.
The potential exculpatory nature of this lost data further exacerbates the concerns about a fair trial being compromised.
Regardless of fault, losing potentially critical evidence further obscures the truth and weakens the defendant's ability to mount a defense.
Procedural Omissions: 
Probable Cause Defects: 

IV.
Systemic Corruption 
Beyond the individual instances of misconduct and error, the report paints a disturbing picture of potential systemic corruption and deeply ingrained confirmation bias within the Lee County justice system.
This suggests a system where personal connections and potential undue influence compromise impartiality and fairness.
Such systemic corruption, if substantiated, would represent a profound betrayal of public trust and a fundamental threat to the rule of law.
Systemic Integrity Concerns:
Structural Prejudice:


Conclusion: A Clarion Call for Justice and Systemic Reform
The Benjamin Allen case is not merely a chronicle of errors and missteps; it is a damning indictment of systemic failures, procedural violations, and misconduct that demand immediate and comprehensive review.
The sheer volume and gravity of the issues raised – from investigative bias and prosecutorial overreach to ineffective defense counsel and potential systemic corruption – paint a profoundly compromised justice system.
A comprehensive re-examination of the evidence, witness testimonies, and procedural records is imperative.
Furthermore, systemic reforms are urgently needed to prevent future miscarriages of justice, including enhanced oversight of investigative and prosecutorial conduct, robust mechanisms for addressing ineffective assistance of counsel, and stringent safeguards against potential conflicts of interest and systemic corruption.
The principles of fairness, due process, and equal justice under law, which the Supreme Court has championed over many years, are not mere abstractions; they are the bedrock of our legal system and the guarantor of individual liberty.
The Benjamin Allen case, as described, represents a profound challenge to these principles, demanding a resolute and unwavering commitment to truth, justice, and systemic reform.
Failure to act decisively will not only perpetuate a grave injustice in this specific case but will further erode public trust in the very foundations of our legal system.
The pursuit of justice demands nothing less than a complete and transparent reckoning with the systemic failures in this disturbing report.
Recommendations:
Dismissal with Prejudice
Under NCGS §15A-954(a)(4), dismissal is warranted due to the irreparable harm caused by prosecutorial misconduct, destruction of evidence, and lack of essential defense resources.
Disciplinary Action Against ADA  
File a formal disciplinary complaint in accordance with Rule 3.8 of the ABA Model Rules, outlining the ADA’s misrepresentation, intimidation, and suppression of exculpatory evidence.
§1983)  
A civil rights lawsuit should be drafted to address malicious prosecution, violations of the Fourth Amendment (lack of probable cause), and systemic due process violations under the Fourteenth Amendment.
The identified defendants include investigative officials whose misconduct surpassed prosecutorial immunity.

Report on Critical Issues within the Criminal Justice System:
Analysis of Benjamin Allen Case File

Executive Summary
This report presents a comprehensive analysis of the Allen case file, revealing numerous critical failures and misconduct throughout various stages of the criminal justice process.
The identified issues encompass judicial oversight, investigative procedures, prosecutorial conduct, evidence handling, defense representation, and systemic vulnerabilities.
These failures raise significant concerns about due process, fair trial rights, and the potential for wrongful convictions.
This document underscores specific procedural lapses, ethical violations, and intentional misconduct, highlighting the urgent need for systemic reforms and a thorough case review.
Investigative Failures and Detective Misconduct
Benjamin S. Allen Case: Systemic Breakdown
This case is emblematic of a profound systemic failure characterized by alleged misconduct, significant investigative lapses, and ineffective legal counsel.
Detective Bias: The investigation was demonstrably biased, compromising the impartiality and thoroughness expected in criminal proceedings.
Evidence Mishandling: Evidence mishandling raises questions about the integrity and reliability of the evidence presented.
Formal Misconduct Complaints: To underscore the severity of the ethical and procedural concerns, formal complaints must be filed against the investigating detective and Assistant District Attorney for professional misconduct.
Systemic Reform Imperative: These failures are not isolated incidents but point to systemic issues within the Lee County Sherrif’s Department and Lee County judicial frameworks, necessitating broader reforms to prevent future miscarriages of justice.
This situation presents serious constitutional and legal challenges.
Prosecutorial Misconduct
ADA (Assistant District Attorney) Issues: Ethical Lapses
The Assistant District Attorney's (ADA) conduct reveals multiple instances of prosecutorial misconduct, undermining the fairness and impartiality of the legal process.
Procedural Abuse: Excessive Continuances: The case was subjected to excessive continuances – 37 times over four years – constituting procedural abuse and causing undue hardship to the defendant, including the loss of evidence critical to the case.
Discovery Violations: Discovery violations further prejudiced against the defendant's defense ability.
Due Process Violations: Fair Trial Infringement
Cumulative Violations: The combination of discovery violations, lost evidence, and excessive delays collectively infringed upon the defendant's fundamental right to a fair trial and due process as guaranteed by the Constitution.
Evidence Collection and Handling Issues
Serious Evidence Collection Failures: Procedural Negligence
Significant failures in evidence collection and handling highlight systemic weaknesses in investigative procedures.
Crime Scene Neglect: Failure to collect evidence from crime scenes and inadequate crime-scene investigation procedures demonstrate a lack of thoroughness.
Chain of Custody Problems: Breakdowns in the chain of custody for evidence compromise the integrity and admissibility of collected materials.
Defense Representation Issues
Ineffective Assistance of Counsel: Attorney Deficiencies
The defendant suffered from ineffective assistance of counsel, significantly undermining their ability to receive a fair defense.
Jury Impact: These failures negatively impacted the jury's verdict, prejudicing the trial's outcome.
Attorney Conflict of Interest: A critical conflict of interest existed because the attorney had a previous relationship with the detective, which compromised the attorney's impartiality and effectiveness.
Defense Representation Issues
Ineffective Assistance of Counsel
In this case, erroneous convictions were not due to single errors but resulted from a compounding effect of initial investigative mistakes exacerbated by subsequent failures throughout the legal process.
Inadequate Defense Preparation: Defense attorneys failed to prepare adequate defenses, weakening the defendant's position.
Prosecutorial Misconduct Following Initial Errors: Prosecutorial misconduct compounded the initial investigative errors, creating a cascade of injustice.
Brady Violations: Exculpatory Evidence Suppression
Brady violations refer to instances where prosecutors fail to disclose material evidence favorable to the defendant, as established by the landmark Supreme Court case Brady v. Maryland (373 U.S. 83, 1963).
This ruling established that suppression of evidence favorable to an accused violates due process when the evidence is material either to guilt or punishment, regardless of the prosecution's good faith or bad faith.
Key Legal Principles Related to Brady Violations
Basic Obligation: The prosecution must disclose all favorable, material evidence to the defense, even without a specific request from the defendant.
Types of Evidence That Must Be Disclosed:
Evidence that tends to negate guilt
Evidence that mitigates an offense or potential sentence
Impeachment evidence that affects witness credibility
Evidence discrediting police investigation or officers' credibility


Materiality Standard: Evidence is considered material "if there is a reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the result of the proceeding would have been different" (United States v. Bagley, 473 U.S. 667, 682, 1985).
Timing of Disclosure: The prosecution must provide Brady material in time for the defendant to effectively use it at trial.
Evidence Need Not Be Admissible: The prosecution must disclose favorable, material evidence, even if it would be inadmissible at trial, as long as it could lead to admissible evidence.
Legal Basis: Napue v. Illinois established that prosecutors violate defendants' due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment when allowing false testimony to go uncorrected.
Misuse of Grand Jury Processes
The ADA persists in employing grand jury practices explicitly declared unconstitutional, such as introducing misleading evidence and false testimony.
Legal Basis: Misleading a grand jury or knowingly introducing false evidence violates a defendant's Fifth Amendment right to due process and fair proceedings.
Such misuse directly undermines the integrity of the judicial process, constituting actionable prosecutorial misconduct under §1983.
Violation of Established Brady Obligations
The prosecutors' obligations to disclose exculpatory evidence (Brady v. Maryland), the ADA deliberately withholds such evidence, depriving defendants of their right to a fair trial.
Legal Basis: Withholding exculpatory evidence violates Brady v. Maryland and subsequent decisions (e.g., Giglio v. United States), infringing on defendants’ Fourteenth Amendment rights to due process and fair trial.
Prosecutorial misconduct of this type is explicitly actionable.
Failure to Comply with Declared Right to Speedy Trial
The ADA denied the defendant’s right to a speedy trial by unnecessarily delaying, depriving the defendant of timely adjudication and fundamental procedural fairness.
Legal Basis: The Sixth Amendment unequivocally establishes defendants' right to a speedy trial, as reinforced by Barker v. Wingo.
Intentional or unnecessary prosecutorial delays explicitly violate this fundamental constitutional protection.
Abuse of Plea-Bargaining Processes
ADA lied about evidence and inflated charges, creating harsher penalties to induce a guilty plea.
Legal Basis: Prosecutors violate due process under the Fourteenth Amendment when engaging in coercive or fraudulent plea-bargaining tactics.
Lying about evidence or inflating charges to coerce guilty pleas directly violates constitutional guarantees of fairness and voluntariness in criminal proceedings.
Denial of Constitutional Rights to Discovery
The ADA denied the defendant access to critical discovery materials, violating the defendant’s constitutional right to comprehensive pre-trial discovery.
Legal Basis: Denial of discovery materials necessary for defense violates defendants' rights to a fair trial under the Sixth Amendment and due process under the Fourteenth Amendment.
Such violations explicitly contravene precedents established by Brady, which requires comprehensive disclosure of exculpatory evidence.
Legal Principal Violations: This manipulation violated several fundamental legal principles:
Hearsay rules
Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment
Best Evidence Rule
Authentication requirements
8.
Specific Legal Concerns: This conflict directly infringed upon:
Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable searches and seizures.
Fourteenth Amendment due process clause.
Legal precedent established in Giglio v. United States regarding the mandatory disclosure of witness credibility issues.
Rushed and Incomplete Investigation: Insufficient Legal Basis
Premature Capital Offense Charge: The detective charged the suspect with a capital offense after a mere four-hour investigation, demonstrating a rush to judgment without proper evidentiary foundation.
Violation of Probable Cause Standard: This rushed approach violated the established legal standard for probable cause as defined in Illinois v. Gates, which requires a comprehensive "totality of the circumstances" analysis.
Aggravating Factor Manipulation: After the defendant refused to accept the plea, the ADA returned to the Grand Jury to introduce an aggravating factor, suggesting retaliatory and unethical tactics.
Violations of Chain of Custody Procedures
Evidence Handling Failures: Integrity Compromised
Chain of Custody Breaches: Significant failures in maintaining proper chain of custody for evidence were identified, compromising the integrity of evidentiary materials.
Specific Failures: These breaches included:
Improper securing of evidence.
Violation of Speedy Trial Rights
Excessive Continuances: Due Process Erosion
Unjustified Delays: The prosecution's continuing the case 37 times over four years is highly unusual and represents an egregious abuse of court resources and process.
Harmful Impacts of Delays: This persistent delay tactic resulted in:
Severe emotional distress to the defendant.
Impairment of the defendant's ability to adequately prepare for trial.
Potential prejudice against the defendant in the eyes of the jury.
Legal Standard Ignored: These delays contravene the principles established in Barker v. Wingo, emphasizing that deliberate attempts to delay trials should be heavily weighted against the prosecution.
Prejudicial Impact of Prolonged Case
Economic and Emotional Harm: Defendant Prejudice
Significant Prejudice: The defendant suffered substantial prejudice due to the prolonged case duration.
Specific Harms: These included:
Complete loss of income for the defendant, a single father, throughout the protracted legal proceedings.
Immediate job termination and inability to secure new employment without attorney approval, causing severe financial strain.
Loss of critical evidence by the defendant's attorneys during the extended timeframe, hampering the defense.
Denial of Right to Assert Speedy Trial Claims
Ignored Constitutional Rights: Attorney Negligence
Sixth Amendment Rights Ignored: The defendant's repeated attempts to assert his Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial were actively thwarted as his attorneys refused to file the necessary motions.
Misinformation to Defendant: The defendant was repeatedly misinformed that his Sixth Amendment rights were not applicable, demonstrating a profound misunderstanding or deliberate misrepresentation of constitutional law by his legal counsel.
Consequences of Bias: This bias led to:
Failure to comprehensively gather and impartially evaluate all available evidence.
Active disregard of evidence that could potentially exonerate the defendant.
Possible attempt to conceal law enforcement actions during the unaccounted hour.
Coordination among multiple conspirators, pointing to a deliberate plan.
Ethical Misconduct in Handling Exculpatory Evidence
Attorneys Concealing Exculpatory Evidence: Legal Ethics Breach
Exculpatory Evidence Withholding: The defendant's attorney failed to disclose bribery text messages to the sheriff's office, representing a serious breach of legal ethics.
Potential Obstruction of Justice: This failure to disclose potentially constitutes obstruction of justice, further compounding the ethical violations.
Overcharging as Prosecutorial Strategy
Deliberate Misrepresentation to Grand Jury: Abusive Tactics
Plea Deal Misunderstanding Admission: The ADA admitted, in the presence of a judge and attorneys, offering a plea deal based on a misunderstanding of the evidence, yet continued to pursue charges.
Specific Violations: These procedural failures included:
Failure to document probable cause for arrest.
Not bringing the defendant before a magistrate for prompt judicial review.
Using a retrospective order to justify detention after it had already occurred.
Officer's Statement of Role to "Prove Guilt"
Explicit Bias from Law Enforcement: Impartiality Compromised
Bias Statement: An officer was recorded stating that their job was to "prove guilt," openly demonstrating a blatant violation of the fundamental duty to be fair and impartial in investigations.
Evidence of Misconduct: This statement is direct evidence of police misconduct and bias against the defendant, undermining the investigation's integrity.
Systemic Corruption in the Justice System
Network of Improper Relationships: Systemic Integrity Concerns
Improper Network: Detective Freeman's documented connection to the defendant's attorney and their history of collaborative casework suggest a potential network of improper relationships.
Influence on the Justice System: This network raises serious concerns about potential undue influence and systemic corruption within the local justice system, which could impact case outcomes and fairness.
Further Ethical Violation: This action represents a further violation of ethical obligations and a deliberate attempt to mislead the jury with false information from the outset of the trial.
Appearance of Concealment: This loss of evidence represents a serious breakdown in evidence handling and creates a strong appearance of deliberate concealment of potentially exculpatory information.
This suggests evidence being introduced after the fact without adherence to proper documentation or chain of custody protocols.
Hospital Officials Failure to Follow Protocol
Medical Record Irregularities: Protocol Breaches
Mandatory Reporting Concerns: Testimony regarding events at Central Carolina Hospital (CCH) raises serious concerns about whether hospital officials properly adhered to mandatory reporting laws for sexual assault cases.
Transparency Compromised: Withholding these critical emergency records undermines transparency and public trust in the investigation process.
Conclusion
The cumulative effect of these identified issues paints a disturbing picture of systemic failures, procedural violations, and potential misconduct within the criminal justice process in this case.
From judicial oversights to investigative biases, prosecutorial overreach, evidence mishandling, and inadequate defense representation, nearly every stage of the process exhibits critical flaws.
The sheer volume and severity of these issues underscore a profound miscarriage of justice and necessitate immediate, comprehensive review and systemic reforms to prevent future occurrences and ensure that principles of fairness, due process, and constitutional rights are upheld for all individuals within the justice system.
This case demands a thorough re-examination and appropriate corrective actions to restore faith in the integrity of the legal process.

Report on Critical Issues within the Criminal Justice System:
Analysis of Benjamin Allen Case File

Executive Summary
This report provides a detailed analysis of the Allen case file, identifying critical failures and potential misconduct at various stages of the criminal justice process.
The issues include investigative procedures, prosecutorial conduct, evidence handling, defense representation, and systemic vulnerabilities.
These raise concerns about due process, fair trial rights, and the potential for wrongful convictions.
This document outlines procedural lapses and ethical concerns, emphasizing the need for systemic reforms and a comprehensive case review.1
Notably, the trial resulted in a mistrial due to a hung jury (unanimous not guilty on first-degree forcible rape; 9-3 split on second-degree forcible rape after approximately 7 hours of deliberation).
There was no conviction, and given the evidentiary weaknesses and procedural issues, a retrial may raise double jeopardy concerns or questions of prosecutorial discretion under principles from Oregon v. Kennedy, 456 U.S. 667 (1982) (mistrial due to prosecutorial misconduct bars retrial if intended to provoke it).
The case highlights broader systemic problems in Lee County, North Carolina, warranting an independent review.
July 10, 2023: Trial begins; witnesses testify (e.g., Deal, Freeman).
Investigative Failures and Detective Misconduct
This case highlights systemic failures, including potential investigative oversights and conflicts of interest.2
Detective Bias: The investigation raises concerns about impartiality due to apparent oversights in witness selection and evidence collection, including an undisclosed familial relationship between Detective Freeman and key witness Carmen Love (his family member), creating a conflict of interest that violated ethical standards under North Carolina State Bar Rule 1.7 and potentially due process under the Fourteenth Amendment.3
Evidence Mishandling: Evidence was not collected or preserved properly (e.g., no DNA from the crime scene beyond photos; pants collected that were claimed to be the claimant's but never tested; chain-of-custody breaks requiring replacement documents at trial), raising integrity concerns under N.C. Gen. Stat.
§ 15A-268.4
Formal Misconduct Complaints: Given the procedural issues, consider filing complaints with the North Carolina State Bar under Rule 8.3 (reporting professional misconduct) against Freeman and the ADA.5
Systemic Reform Imperative: These issues suggest broader problems in the Lee County Sheriff’s Department, warranting reforms such as mandatory conflict disclosures and evidence training per N.C. Gen. Stat.
Procedural deficiencies include no magistrate review post-arrest, violating Fourth Amendment due process.15
Failure to Collect/Preserve Evidence: No physical samples from the scene (e.g., bedding); used a lack of evidence against Allen (e.g., insinuating garbage bags hid items).
This violates speedy trial rights under Barker v. Wingo, 407 U.S. 514 (1972).19
Discovery Violations: Medical records delayed until trial day; exculpatory evidence suppressed (e.g., video contradictions, extortion motive), constituting Brady violations under Kyles v. Whitley, 514 U.S. 419 (1995).20
Misuse of Grand Jury: False claims (e.g., sperm/DNA presence) presented, violating due process under Napue.21
Failure to Correct False Testimony: Allowed Freeman's perjured claims of not knowing possible witnesses and arrest claims to stand.22
Abuse of Plea-Bargaining: Lied about evidence to coerce plea; retaliatory aggravating factor added.23
Evidence Collection and Handling Issues
Crime Scene Neglect: No evidence collected beyond photos; pants untested for ownership/gender.
Exculpatory Evidence Suppression
Brady violations through non-disclosure of material evidence (e.g., Love's fabrications, video, or extortion), meeting the materiality standard under United States v. Bagley, 473 U.S. 667 (1985).
Tied to the Barker prejudice factor.30
Conclusion and Broader Reforms
This case exemplifies investigative and prosecutorial misconduct leading to a mistrial.
Recommend independent review by the North Carolina Innocence Inquiry Commission; implement ABA Model Rule 1.7 training on conflicts; file §1983 claims for civil remedies under 42 U.S.C.
Chain-of-custody issues from trial transcript.
Ethical complaint suggestion.
Warrantless arrest per magistrate order.
Perjury on arrest process from testimony and the court documentation 
Probable cause deficiencies detailed in new doc.
Prosecutorial issues from original.
My attorneys were never allowed to review them and were not informed they were in the courthouse until we were already in court for trial.
This also brings to light something else my attorneys didn’t address.
For example, the visiting Judge finally learned that the medical records were downstairs in another Judge's box on the day of the trial.
I guess the scales of justice must be weighed with cash.
I can An investigation was to be conducted And ignored Essential elements That protect a person civil rights.
And we've been able to lay out How the defendant is innocent.
Deconstruction of that false narrative Is important for multiple reasons, Not only for the violations of civil rights But also To allow my client to go free.
The fact that after four phone calls And an interview with my client That he was arrested Is a travesty 

So, since the institution of British common law until now, We have Hundreds of years.
Of development, A protections for the accused.
And this one, They're already bend A great expense That was ignored On Another Case.
This one reason alone Should ensure that the bar Not only sanctions him, But that sanction should be To remove all his law license.
Such things as Innocence, Right?
It is weighed by familiar connections that you could Advantage and take advantage of 

It is weighed By the moral bankruptcy That it takes For these people To commit such acts.
I fully believe that this attorney Was doing his best to uphold his responsibility to me, as a client.
So they can see And not be blonde Like this court Is To justice.
This court sees the Injustice That was voiced Upon this man.
They violate The very core Of what makes A person a person.
This analysis is based on the document's professional, legal-oriented structure, which includes sections on trial proceedings, statements, crime circumstances, timeline verification, and a formatted witness testimony.
Key Themes/Topics
The document focuses on several interconnected themes related to a legal case, likely involving a criminal trial.
The primary topics include:


Trial Procedures and Procedural Irregularities: This is evident in Section 1, which discusses an attorney's attempt to call a witness being thwarted by the Assistant District Attorney (ADA) overrunning her allotted time.
It highlights issues of courtroom management and fairness in legal proceedings.
Verification and Accuracy of Accounts: Sections 3 and 4 emphasize documenting and cross-referencing timelines and statements related to an alleged crime.
This touches on themes of legacy evidence, admissibility, and the impact of unavailable witnesses.
Overall, the document revolves around themes of legal documentation, procedural integrity, and the reconstruction of events in a criminal context, possibly involving assault or a similar offense based on the transcript's details (e.g., references to a SANE nurse and a victim's partial nudity).
Legal Issues/Risks/Arguments
The document raises several potential legal issues, risks, and arguments, primarily in the context of criminal trial procedures, evidence admissibility, and factual verification.
These could be leveraged in legal arguments or pose risks if not addressed:


Procedural Fairness and Due Process (Section 1): The ADA overrunning her time, preventing Ben's attorney from calling a witness, could be argued as a violation of the defendant's right to present a defense under the Sixth Amendment (U.S. context).
Risks include appeals based on procedural errors, such as abuse of discretion by the court or unequal treatment of parties.
This might lead to motions for mistrials or retrials if it impacted the trial's outcome.
If these statements were online and publicly available, arguments might center on their relevance, reliability, or potential for prejudice.
Risks include challenges to the trial's integrity if similar evidence was mishandled, potentially leading to appeals on grounds of incomplete discovery or evidentiary errors.
Legal risks include challenges to the prosecution's case if timelines are inaccurate, potentially affecting chain of custody for evidence or alibis.
This might be used in cross-examination or motions to suppress evidence, emphasizing the need for corroboration to avoid risks like wrongful conviction or defense challenges.
Transcript and Testimony Issues (Transcript Excerpt): The excerpt describes sensitive details (e.g., a victim's state of undress and interactions at hospitals), which could involve risks of privacy violations (e.g., under HIPAA for medical information) or retraumatization in court.
Overall, the document mitigates some risks by emphasizing accuracy and professionalism, but unresolved discrepancies could expose parties to appeals, sanctions, or civil liabilities.
Key indicators include:


Neutrality: Phrases like "ensure this detail is included," "verify the timelines," and "cross-reference these accounts for accuracy" maintain an objective stance, presenting information as a straightforward record rather than advocating for a side.
Cooperativeness: The document's purpose appears to involve collaboration, as seen in the introductory note about revisions (e.g., addressing errors and refining for legal standards).
The language is formal, with precise terminology (e.g., "Assistant District Attorney") and structured formatting (e.g., Q&A for the transcript), which conveys a tone of diligence and respect for legal norms.
This tone aligns with legal documentation standards, where impartiality is crucial to maintain credibility and avoid influencing interpretations.
Purpose/Objective
The primary purpose of the document is to refine and organize legal notes and testimony for accuracy, professionalism, and use in ongoing or future legal proceedings.
It serves as a revised draft aimed at:


Ensuring Clarity and Compliance: The introduction explicitly states that the revisions address spelling, grammar, terminology, and ambiguities to make the content "suitable for legal purposes."
This suggests an objective of creating a reliable record that can withstand scrutiny in court, such as in trial preparation, appeals, or evidentiary reviews.
Facilitating Reference and Verification: By structuring the content into clear sections (e.g., for trial proceedings, statements, and timelines), the document's objective is to aid legal professionals in quickly accessing and cross-referencing information.
Promoting Accuracy in Legal Documentation: The emphasis on verifying facts and editing for precision indicates a broader goal of mitigating risks in legal practice, such as errors that could lead to challenges or dismissals.
Ultimately, it positions the document as a tool for cooperative refinement, potentially leading to a "final copy" for use in formal contexts like court filings or internal reviews.
In summary, the document's objective is practical and supportive, focusing on enhancing the quality of legal materials rather than advancing a specific argument or agenda.
--- Summary (medium / legal) ---
Below is a medium-length summary of the analysis context, focusing on the legal aspects of the revised notes and transcript excerpt.
This summary draws from the document's content, emphasizing key legal themes, issues, risks, arguments, sentiment, and purpose.
It is structured into clear points for readability, highlighting how the material supports or challenges legal proceedings.
Key Legal Themes/Topics
The document centers on core legal themes in criminal trial contexts, such as procedural integrity, evidence management, and factual verification.
It explores trial irregularities (e.g., time overruns preventing witness testimony), the handling of deceased witnesses' statements, and the reconstruction of crime timelines.
These themes underscore the importance of due process and reliable evidence under legal frameworks like the U.S. Sixth Amendment, which protects the right to a fair trial.
Additionally, the transcript's details on victim interactions and witness accounts highlight themes of evidence admissibility and witness credibility, common in cases involving assault or related offenses, where accurate documentation is crucial for building or challenging a case.
Legal Issues, Risks, and Arguments
Several legal risks emerge from the document, particularly around procedural fairness, evidence rules, and testimonial reliability.
For instance, the Assistant District Attorney's time overrun could raise arguments of due process violations, potentially leading to appeals based on Sixth Amendment infringements or motions for mistrials.
Evidence-related risks include the dismissal of Ms. Allen's inflammatory statements, which might involve hearsay challenges under Federal Rules of Evidence (e.g., Rules 801–803), risking appeals if deemed improperly excluded.
Overall, these issues highlight potential liabilities, such as wrongful convictions or civil claims (e.g., privacy breaches under HIPAA in the transcript), emphasizing the need for thorough verification to mitigate risks in legal proceedings.
Sentiment and Tone in a Legal Context
The document maintains a neutral, professional, and cooperative tone, which is essential for legal credibility and impartiality.
In a legal setting, this tone enhances the document's reliability as a tool for court filings or appeals, fostering trust among legal professionals.
However, its cooperative nature—evident in calls for further refinement—could be strategically used to demonstrate diligence in addressing ambiguities, thereby reducing risks of challenges based on incomplete or unprofessional documentation.
Purpose and Objective from a Legal Perspective
The primary objective is to refine legal documentation for accuracy, compliance, and utility in proceedings, such as trials or appeals.
By organizing content into structured sections (e.g., trial proceedings and witness testimony), the document aims to facilitate reference, fact-checking, and evidence preparation, aligning with legal standards for clarity and professionalism.
This serves to minimize risks like evidentiary errors or procedural disputes, ultimately supporting tasks such as discovery responses or case building.
In essence, it functions as a collaborative tool to ensure the final version withstands legal scrutiny, promoting ethical and effective legal practice.
I have addressed spelling errors (e.g., "overan" to "overran"), improved grammar and punctuation for clarity and readability, refined terminology for accuracy and professionalism (e.g., ensuring consistent use of legal terms like "Assistant District Attorney"), resolved ambiguities (e.g., clarifying incomplete sentences and vague references), and maintained a professional legal tone throughout.
They assess things such as Allegiance to the United States, Foreign Influence, Sexual Behavior, Personal Conduct, Financial Considerations, Alcohol Consumption, Drug Involvement, Psychological Conditions, and Criminal Conduct, among others.
The purpose is not to catch someone in a lie but to ensure that they’re trustworthy and able to handle the responsibilities that come with this clearance.
I repeatedly asked for a speedier trial but was pushed off by my attorneys.
The court ruled me indigent.
My attorneys were never allowed to review them and were not informed they were in the courthouse until we were already in court for trial.
This also brings to light something else my attorneys didn’t address.
For example, the visiting Judge finally learned that the medical records were downstairs in another Judge's box on the day of the trial.
I guess the scales of justice must be weighed with cash.

It is a hearing to determine the admissibility of evidence, or the competency of a witness or juror.
As the subject matter of the voir dire often relates to evidence, competence or other matters that may lead to bias on behalf of the jury, the jury may be removed from the court for the voir dire.
Case Analysis and Fact Gathering:
Thoroughly review all available evidence, statements, and documents related to the case.
Exclusion of relevant evidence on grounds of prejudice, confusion, or waste of time.
– Evidence of a pertinent trait of his character offered by an accused, or by the prosecution to rebut the same;
Rule 607. Who may impeach.
– If, while testifying, a witness uses a writing or object to refresh his memory, an adverse party is entitled to have the writing or object produced at the trial, hearing, or deposition in which the witness is testifying.
– If, before testifying, a witness uses a writing or object to refresh his memory for the purpose of testifying and the court in its discretion determines that the interests of justice so require, an adverse party is entitled to have those portions of any writing or of the object which relate to the testimony produced, if practicable, at the trial, hearing, or deposition in which the witness is testifying.
– A party entitled to have a writing or object produced under this rule is entitled to inspect it, to cross‑examine the witness thereon, and to introduce in evidence those portions which relate to the testimony of the witness.
If production of the writing or object at the trial, hearing, or deposition is impracticable, the court may order it made available for inspection.
If it is claimed that the writing or object contains privileged information or information not directly related to the subject matter of the testimony, the court shall examine the writing or object in camera, excise any such portions, and order delivery of the remainder to the party entitled thereto.
Any portion withheld over objections shall be preserved and made available to the appellate court in the event of an appeal.
If a writing or object is not produced, made available for inspection, or delivered pursuant to order under this rule, the court shall make any order justice requires, but in criminal cases if the prosecution elects not to comply, the order shall be one striking the testimony or, if justice so requires, declaring a mistrial.
Although relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.

August 14, 2009 "Defendant seeks to preclude plaintiff or plaintiff's counsel from referring to the incident upon which the action is based as a "rape" or a "sexual assault."
"However, in describing his current mental state or his response to the incident, plaintiff intends to use the word "rape."
"Plaintiff contends that the actual incident, during which an inmate touched his penis and buttocks while other inmates held him down, is accurately characterized as a "sexual assault."
The Court will not prohibit plaintiff from using the word "rape" as long as the word is not used in an effort to characterize the actual event, but instead is used only in connection with plaintiff's mental state or emotional response to the incident.
Similarly, the Court will not prohibit plaintiff from using the term "sexual assault."
The term "sexual assault," as defined by Ohio law, includes conduct that plaintiff claimcarmens occurred.
Defendant, of course, may propose a limiting instruction as to these terms."
Identify potential legal theories and defenses.
Formulate a trial strategy, including opening and closing arguments.
File and argue any necessary motions, such as motions to suppress evidence or limit the prosecution's case.
Pre-Trial Preparation:
Develop a trial theme and theory.
Trial:
Present the defense case.
Engage in jury selection, opening statements, direct and cross-examinations, and closing arguments.
Post-Trial:
Address any post-trial motions or appeals.
Technology: Utilize legal software and tools for case management, evidence organization, and trial presentation.
This outline provides a starting point for a holistic defense strategy, but it should be tailored to the specifics of each case and jurisdiction.
When the officer has probable cause to believe a felony has been committed, even if not witnessed2.
For certain misdemeanors specified by state law, even if not witnessed by the officer4.
Limitations on Warrantless Arrests
However, there are important restrictions:
For most misdemeanors not committed in an officer's presence, a warrant is required12.
Officers generally need a warrant to enter a home to make an arrest, with some exceptions like exigent circumstances or hot pursuit23.
A warrant is required to enter a third party's home to make an arrest3.
Concerns with Frequent Warrantless Arrests
A sheriff's deputy making many warrantless arrests could raise several issues:
Potential Fourth Amendment violations if arrests are made without proper probable cause or in situations requiring a warrant5.
Risk of evidence being thrown out in court if arrests are found to be unlawful.
Possible pattern of overreach or disregard for proper procedures.
Proper Procedure
The standard practice for law enforcement should be:
Obtain warrants when required, especially for misdemeanors not witnessed and for entering homes.
Make warrantless arrests only when legally justified and with clear probable cause.
Document the justification for any warrantless arrests thoroughly.
If a sheriff's deputy is consistently making warrantless arrests outside these guidelines, it would be concerning and potentially indicate a need for additional training or supervision to ensure compliance with legal requirements and protection of individuals' rights.
First Amendment Bearing on Probable Cause and Particularity
The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.
Annotations
First Amendment Bearing on Probable Cause and Particularity.—Where the warrant process is used to authorize seizure of books and other items that may be protected by the First Amendment, the Court has required government to observe more exacting standards than in other cases.135 Seizure of materials arguably protected by the First Amendment is a form of prior restraint that requires strict observance of the Fourth Amendment.
At a minimum, a warrant is required, and additional safeguards may be required for large-scale seizures.
Thus, in Marcus v. Search Warrant,136 the seizure of 11,000 copies of 280 publications pursuant to warrant issued ex parte by a magistrate who had not examined any of the publications but who had relied on the conclusory affidavit of a policeman was voided.
Failure to scrutinize the materials and to particularize the items to be seized was deemed inadequate, and it was further noted that police “were provided with no guide to the exercise of informed discretion, because there was no step in the procedure before seizure designed to focus searchingly on the question of obscenity.”137 A state procedure that was designed to comply with Marcus by the presentation of copies of books to be seized to the magistrate for his scrutiny prior to issuance of a warrant was nonetheless found inadequate by a plurality of the Court, which concluded that “since the warrant here authorized the sheriff to seize all copies of the specified titles, and since appellant was not afforded a hearing on the question of the obscenity even of the seven novels seven of 59 listed titles were reviewed by the magistrate before the warrant issued, the procedure was .
constitutionally deficient.”138
Confusion remains, however, about the necessity for and the character of prior adversary hearings on the issue of obscenity.
In a later decision the Court held that, with adequate safeguards, no preseizure adversary hearing on the issue of obscenity is required if the film is seized not for the purpose of destruction as contraband (the purpose in Marcus and A Quantity of Books), but instead to preserve a copy for evidence.139 It is constitutionally permissible to seize a copy of a film pursuant to a warrant as long as there is a prompt post-seizure adversary hearing on the obscenity issue.
Until there is a judicial determination of obscenity, the Court advised, the film may continue to be exhibited; if no other copy is available either a copy of it must be made from the seized film or the film itself must be returned.140
The seizure of a film without the authority of a constitutionally sufficient warrant is invalid; seizure cannot be justified as incidental to arrest, as the determination of obscenity may not be made by the officer himself.141 Nor may a warrant issue based “solely on the conclusory assertions of the police officer without any inquiry by the magistrate into the factual basis for the officer’s conclusions.”142 Instead, a warrant must be “supported by affidavits setting forth specific facts in order that the issuing magistrate may ‘focus searchingly on the question of obscenity.’”143 This does not mean, however, that a higher standard of probable cause is required in order to obtain a warrant to seize materials protected by the First Amendment.
of reasonableness’ was not intended to establish a ‘higher’ standard of probable cause for the issuance of a warrant to seize books or films, but instead related to the more basic requirement, imposed by that decision, that the police not rely on the ‘exigency’ exception to the Fourth Amendment warrant requirement, but instead obtain a warrant from a magistrate .
.’”144
In Stanford v. Texas,145 the Court voided a seizure of more than 2,000 books, pamphlets, and other documents pursuant to a warrant that merely authorized the seizure of books, pamphlets, and other written instruments “concerning the Communist Party of Texas.” “The constitutional requirement that warrants must particularly describe the ‘things to be seized’ is to be accorded the most scrupulous exactitude when the ‘things’ are books, and the basis for their seizure is the ideas which they contain.
No less a standard could be faithful to First Amendment freedoms.”146
However, the First Amendment does not bar the issuance or execution of a warrant to search a newsroom to obtain photographs of demonstrators who had injured several policemen, although the Court appeared to suggest that a magistrate asked to issue such a warrant should guard against interference with press freedoms through limits on type, scope, and intrusiveness of the search.147
135 Marcus v. Search Warrant, 367 U.S. 717, 730–31 (1961); Stanford v. Texas, 379 U.S. 476, 485 (1965).
For First Amendment implications of seizures under the Federal Racketeer Inﬂuenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), see First Amendment: Obscenity and Prior Restraint.
Video, Inc., 475 U.S. 868, 875 n.6 (1986), rejecting the defendant’s assertion, based on Heller, that only a single copy rather than all copies of allegedly obscene movies should have been seized pursuant to warrant.
These special constraints are inapplicable when obscene materials are purchased, and there is consequently no Fourth Amendment search or seizure.
§ 2000aa, Congress provided extensive protection against searches and seizures not only of the news media and news people but also of others engaged in disseminating communications to the public, unless there is probable cause to believe the person protecting the materials has committed or is committing the crime to which the materials relate.

A commitment question is one that “commits a prospective juror to resolve, or to refrain from resolving, an issue a certain way after learning a particular fact.”  Standefer, 59 S.W.3d at 179.
The line between a proper and an improper commitment question is not always a bright one.
This discussion of framing voir dire questions only scratches the surface.

Introduction 
I wanted to start a little better than I did with my last attorney.
Even on the last day of court, he still called me a contractor.
I will attempt to communicate more effectively to ensure that I am not wasting your time looking through materials to ascertain answers that I should have provided upfront.
Work History
Continually performed within the top 15% of Agency employees
Received multiple awards, including 2 Superior Civilian Awards, while deployed to active war zones.
Extensive experience in developing multifunctional teams to solve Department of Defense (DoD) issues impacting the DoD Digital Modernization Strategy
Advisor to C-level equivalent (General/SES) for over ten years
Ability to coordinate integration efforts across multiple DoD components.
I have held a Top Secret / Sensitive Compartmented Information for over 20 years.
SCI clearance investigations involve an additional screening process.
Not everyone with a Top Secret (TS) clearance has SCI access.
You are only eligible for SCI screening if specific duties require access to this information.
This required Single Scope Background Investigations, which are extensive background checks and investigation processes that can take several months or even years to complete.
A single-scope background investigation (SSBI) is the most comprehensive investigation that the government can conduct, in addition to interviews and reviews of financial, criminal, and medical records.
It is designed to assess honesty and integrity by measuring various physiological responses while answering several questions.
I also held additional clearance levels reserved for individuals requiring access to sensitive or compartmented information.
These include Special Access Programs (SAP) created for specific government projects or programs requiring additional screening.
These Control System caveats included GAMMA, TALENT KEYHOLE, HUMINT, and SI.
SI / GAMMA - This sub-control system of SI is for highly sensitive communication intercepts (product or content) * and, therefore, requires the ORCON dissemination marking.
GAMMA may contain compartments identified by a codeword or an identifier of four alphabetic characters.
HUMINT/HCS -This control system is intended to provide enhanced protection to exceptionally fragile clandestine HUMINT sources, methods, and activities based on assessed value, critical nature, and information vulnerability.
TALENT KEYHOLE – Covers space-based IMINT (imagery intelligence), SIGINT (signals intelligence), and MASINT (measurement and signature intelligence) collection platforms; related processing and analysis techniques; and research, design, and operation of these platforms.

FAMILY BACKGROUND
I was told by my first attorney (Frank Collins) that this would never have been tried if it hadn’t been for statements made by Tiffany Allen.
We have a long history in the Family Courts in Lee County.
I turned the phone over to my attorney.
It was misplaced during the transition between lawyers in the firm after the State asked for 37 continuances.
I am unable to work due to the requirements placed on me by the government, so the ADA used this to drain my resources.
I am a single father struggling to support two children with no income.
I still had the examples I sent to my first attorney, but that is all.
I will include snapshots that I sent to my first attorney.
I would pass over the phone and data, but this was misplaced by my attorneys at some point over the past few years.
Brendan Allen – (484)929-6524
Carter Olson – (507)822-8214
Morgan and Lukas still live with me, but I could have made them available if they had even thought to ask.
Former Family Law Paralegal at Wilson, Reives, Silverman & Doran, PLLC.
Worked for the local government since 2013.
He is a building inspector for the local government.
His father works with the police department.
The request was entered on Dec 9th, 2019.
The ADA, my attorneys, and the judge had to track them down the day of court.
I told my attorney that this was impossible.
The ADA, my attorneys, and the judge sat down to discuss.
The ADA was informed that the expert had a set time to leave because he had surgery scheduled.
The ADA said that there would be plenty of time before then.
Even with the expert being provided, I was still disadvantaged.
I asked my attorneys if they had billed me for time working on the DNA.
I told them I didn’t have any additional resources to spend.
My job was taken away once I was charged.
How was their time being taken away from other avenues of my defense not a disadvantage for me?
The ADA continually delayed turning over documents such as medical records.
A search warrant was served to retrieve an item from my property even after my attorney was informed that it was there, and I was told that the ADA would be contacted to retrieve it.
Other trash from the back of my vehicle was represented as something nefarious, even though they never bothered to retrieve the trash that had been saved for them from the residence or took the trash they tried to represent as evidence.
My attorneys never addressed this, even though I repeatedly sent the property overview and asked where she ran to.
One of the gentleman's father works with the police department.
The other also works in some capacity for the city.
A request to retrieve all email communications and telephone calls from this time period would be appropriate.
The second lesser included charge, the vote was 9-3, both in favor of acquittal.
State of North Carolina vs Benjamin Allen
Case No.
§ 1621 and N.C. Gen. Stat.
Are there patterns of behavior that suggest a need for institutional reform?
This hour difference is crucial to the timeline and could have been used to cover up law enforcement's actions during that time.
This is a crucial investigative tool that was overlooked.
In North Carolina, the standard is similar.
This oversight is particularly egregious.
Case law: In State v. Hicks, 254 N.C. App.
Case law: In Kuehl v. Burtis, 173 F.3d 646 (8th Cir.
It opens the door for a civil rights lawsuit under 42 U.S.C.
§ 1983 for unlawful arrest and detention.
He seems cooperative but concerned about potential impacts on his DOD job.
This requires considering all available information, not just isolated facts.

I wanted to start a little better than I did with my last attorney.
Even on the last day of court, he still called me a contractor.
I will attempt to communicate more effectively to ensure that I am not wasting your time looking through materials to ascertain answers that I should have provided upfront.
Work History
Continually performed within the top 15% of Agency employees
Received multiple awards, including 2 Superior Civilian Awards, while deployed to active war zones.
Extensive experience in developing multifunctional teams to solve Department of Defense (DoD) issues impacting the DoD Digital Modernization Strategy
Advisor to C-level equivalent (General/SES) for over ten years
Ability to coordinate integration efforts across multiple DoD components.
I have held a Top Secret / Sensitive Compartmented Information for over 20 years.
SCI clearance investigations involve an additional screening process.
Not everyone with a Top Secret (TS) clearance has SCI access.
You are only eligible for SCI screening if specific duties require access to this information.
This required Single Scope Background Investigations, which are extensive background checks and investigation processes that can take several months or even years to complete.
A single-scope background investigation (SSBI) is the most comprehensive investigation that the government can conduct, in addition to interviews and reviews of financial, criminal, and medical records.
It is designed to assess honesty and integrity by measuring various physiological responses while answering several questions.
I also held additional clearance levels reserved for individuals requiring access to sensitive or compartmented information.
These include Special Access Programs (SAP) created for specific government projects or programs requiring additional screening.
These Control System caveats included GAMMA, TALENT KEYHOLE, HUMINT, and SI.
SI / GAMMA - This sub-control system of SI is for highly sensitive communication intercepts (product or content) * and, therefore, requires the ORCON dissemination marking.
GAMMA may contain compartments identified by a codeword or an identifier of four alphabetic characters.
HUMINT/HCS -This control system is intended to provide enhanced protection to exceptionally fragile clandestine HUMINT sources, methods, and activities based on assessed value, critical nature, and information vulnerability.
TALENT KEYHOLE – Covers space-based IMINT (imagery intelligence), SIGINT (signals intelligence), and MASINT (measurement and signature intelligence) collection platforms; related processing and analysis techniques; and research, design, and operation of these platforms.

FAMILY BACKGROUND
I was told by my first attorney (Frank Collins) that this would never have been tried if it hadn’t been for statements made by Tiffany Allen.
We have a long history in the Family Courts in Lee County.
I turned the phone over to my attorney.
It was misplaced during the transition between lawyers in the firm after the State asked for 37 continuances.
I am unable to work due to the requirements placed on me by the government, so the ADA used this to drain my resources.
I am a single father struggling to support two children with no income.
I still had the examples I sent to my first attorney, but that is all.
I will include snapshots that I sent to my first attorney.
I would pass over the phone and data, but this was misplaced by my attorneys at some point over the past few years.
Brendan Allen – (484)929-6524
Carter Olson – (507)822-8214
Morgan and Lukas still live with me, but I could have made them available if they had even thought to ask.
Former Family Law Paralegal at Wilson, Reives, Silverman & Doran, PLLC.
Worked for the local government since 2013.
He is a building inspector for the local government.
His father works with the police department.
The request was entered on Dec 9th, 2019.
The ADA, my attorneys, and the judge had to track them down the day of court.
I told my attorney that this was impossible.
The ADA, my attorneys, and the judge sat down to discuss.
The ADA was informed that the expert had a set time to leave because he had surgery scheduled.
The ADA said that there would be plenty of time before then.
Even with the expert being provided, I was still disadvantaged.
I asked my attorneys if they had billed me for time working on the DNA.
I told them I didn’t have any additional resources to spend.
My job was taken away once I was charged.
How was their time being taken away from other avenues of my defense not a disadvantage for me?
The ADA continually delayed turning over documents such as medical records.
A search warrant was served to retrieve an item from my property even after my attorney was informed that it was there, and I was told that the ADA would be contacted to retrieve it.
Other trash from the back of my vehicle was represented as something nefarious, even though they never bothered to retrieve the trash that had been saved for them from the residence or took the trash they tried to represent as evidence.
My attorneys never addressed this, even though I repeatedly sent the property overview and asked where she ran to.
One of the gentleman's father works with the police department.
The other also works in some capacity for the city.
A request to retrieve all email communications and telephone calls from this time period would be appropriate.
The second lesser included charge, the vote was 9-3, both in favor of acquittal.

INTRODUCTION TO CHARACTERS
Benjamin Allen – Accused
Lauren Deal - Accuser
Carmen Love -  She spent the evening drinking with Deal at Goodfellas and Schooley’s.
Former Family Law Paralegal at Wilson, Reives, Silverman & Doran, PLLC.
Worked for the local government since 2013 and worked with the detective's brother.
He is a building inspector for the local government.
His father works with the police department.
His father took custody of me the morning I made bail.
Frank Collins – First Attorney
Jason Wunsch – Second Attorney / Knew the detective, so didn’t examine him on the stand
Freddie Cruz – Second Attorney
Detective Steve Freeman – Network of friends with accusing party 

ADA Tiffany Bartholomew:
-Lives in Pinehurst, North Carolina.
From Alexandria, Virginia
-Currently an ADA in Lee County, NC
-Previous ADA in Moore County, NC ~10 years
-During her tenure at Moore County, they had one the highest conviction rates for Sexual Assault in the state.
- Governor Roy Cooper appointed Tiffany Bartholomew, of Pinehurst, as District Court Judge serving Moore and Hoke Counties in 2019.
When I was asked to come back in by my attorney’s assistant, I told them that they could all go fuck themselves.
I can at least sit out here and smoke while y’all fuck me.”
They went upstairs to discuss it with the judge and the ADA in chambers.
The following is a summary of events that encapsulate this issue.
I believe this should be reviewed to determine how this conclusion was reached.
The ADA used multiple underhanded techniques during that time.
These include not turning over documents when agreed and not responding to inquiries promptly.
The request was entered on Dec 9th, 2019.
The ADA, my attorneys, and the judge had to track them down the day of court.
I told my attorney that this was impossible.
The ADA, my attorneys, and the judge sat down to discuss.
The ADA was informed that the expert had a set time to leave because he had surgery scheduled.
The ADA said that there would be plenty of time before then.
Even with the expert being provided, I was still disadvantaged.
I asked my attorneys if they had billed me for time working on the DNA.
I told them I didn’t have any additional resources to spend.
My job was taken away once I was charged.
How was their time being taken away from other avenues of my defense not a disadvantage for me?
The ADA continually delayed turning over documents such as medical records.
A search warrant was served to retrieve an item from my property even after my attorney was informed that it was there, and I was told that the ADA would be contacted to retrieve it.
Other trash from the back of my vehicle was represented as something nefarious, even though they never bothered to retrieve the trash that had been saved for them from the residence or took the trash they tried to represent as evidence.
My attorneys never addressed this, even though I repeatedly sent the property overview and asked where she ran to.
One of the gentleman's father works with the police department.
The other also works in some capacity for the city.
A request to retrieve all email communications and telephone calls from this time period would be appropriate.
The second lesser included charge, the vote was 9-3, both in favor of acquittal.

Investigator Knowledge & State of Mind
Recording Pattern: Freeman was recording calls that day; he also had ready access to who-was-where evidence.
Officer Speaking: Which one?
And as far as I knew, he'd gotten deployed, which he's… 
Officer Speaking: Whats his name?
The lights come on at, like, 1:30, 1:45.
And which I don't know why.
There is no video available that supports any of the above statements, even remotely.
Fact Note: This is impossible.
And the information that you wrote is to the best of your knowledge true at that time?
-This is important in other ways.
ADA Bartholomew: And what information did you get during that brief from Deputy Haines?
My car is a Good Fellows because that's where we were to start with.
This is a series of fabrications on display.
Do we have all the jurors?
Just wanted to clear that up.
LAUREN DEAL DIRECT EXAM cont'd BY MS. BARTHOLOMEW
Q: And what is that?
Is that on your righthand side of your body?
Q: Lauren, I'm handing you
A: collection of photographs that have been labeled State's Exhibit numbers LAUREN DEAL DIRECT EXAM cont'd BY MS. BARTHOLOMEW through for identification.
I would like to go over those exhibits with you.
Do you recognize what's depicted in State's Exhibit number ?
A That was the nature of my question, yes.
Court transcript:
MS. BARTHOLOMEW: Now, you had been in this house several times  before.
There is a set of stairs that go down.
And what social media platform was that?
MS. BARTHOLOMEW: Lauren, I'm handing you what's been marked for identification purposes as a document labeled State's
Exhibit number four.
Do you recognize State's Exhibit number four?
And what do you recognize State's Exhibit number four to be?
MS. BARTHOLOMEW: And do you know how the state came in possession of State's Exhibit number four?
And do you still have the messages on your actual cell phone?
And in State's Exhibit number four, exact copy of the message, looks like it's from 2016 between you and the defendant?
MS. BARTHOLOMEW:  Your honor, at this time, the state would introduce State's Exhibit number four.
We're picking out one page.
Actually, let me see the attorneys first.
MR. WUNSCH:  There is a --
THE COURT:  Just approach, please.
Ladies and gentlemen, I'll ask you just to go back in the jury room for just one moment while I sort this out.
The court is reviewing what appears to be, I guess this is the seven -- are there seven total?
There are six in these sheets.
What appears to be seven screenshots of purported messages.
Anything further that the defense wants to say?
MR. WUNSCH:  Also lacks foundation, your honor.
So there is -- it's clearly not -- you know, we have somebody else identifying themselves.
Court has reviewed State's Exhibit number four.
So now, if you want some of these other pages that even the state concedes appear to be another individual, under the rule of completeness, I'll allow you to do that, but state isn't trying to introduce statements that were purportedly made by Ben -- I mean, by Matt using Ben's phone.
They are simply trying to introduce the very first one.
And again, they will need to link this up with a conversation prior to December 3, 2016.
I'll pass these back to the state.
MR. WUNSCH:  Your honor, we would just note our objection for the record.
[The jury entered the courtroom and were seated in jury box] 
THE COURT:  All right.
Ladies and gentlemen, in my discretion, I have overruled the objection, found the proposed exhibit number four to be admissible and sufficiently reliable to be admitted.
MS. BARTHOLOMEW: So Lauren, if you could just -- is there a date that these messages are set on State's Exhibit number four?
MS. BARTHOLOMEW: And at what time does the first message come in?
MS. BARTHOLOMEW: And what does it say?
Sorry for the short notice.
So what time -- is there a timestamp for when your reply was made?
(The court also flagged Rule 106 completeness for later pages showing “another individual using his phone.”)
Application.
A general question about prior bonfires (“How many times…?” “Maybe five.”).
The “maybe five bonfires” answer proves prior practice, not the required prior conversation specific to the 1:49 text.
That link wasn’t supplied.
And whose vehicle did you drive?
4) This is all a ploy to violate my rights, which they have proven they are willing to do just because they can.
I have been wondering about something.
I was not brought before a magistrate, but the paperwork says I saw Judge Jones on the 21st.
I was arrested on the 19th, and released on the 20th.
As a matter of fact, on the exhibit log it says there is no chain of custody.
A detailed timeline is in the attachment.
Where are the phone logs from the cell I was kept in?
They provide important context for later.
The rights of citizens sure doesn’t matter to this group.
Whole lotta nonsense here that can’t get sorted just in Lee County.
A deal or informal arrangement was made to delay or avoid formal documentation.
These records are public documents and should be available to ensure transparency in law enforcement’s response and hospital reporting practices.
Additional subpoenas need to be issued along with a discovery motion to access all 911 records, incident reports, and hospital documentation related to Deal’s visit to CCH that night.
These documents are essential to understanding the initial law enforcement response and any deviations from the protocol.
This constitutional guarantee is further implemented through statutory provisions.
The North Carolina Court of Appeals affirmed this right's centrality in State v. Bradley, 181 N.C. App.
In cases such as State v. Collins, 50 N.C. App.
155 (1980) and State v. Simmons, 165 N.C. App.
Mr. Browning [ph], I believe you're the foreman?
THE COURT: So I have received your latest note.
(It is in writing with his signature as the Judge calls out his name.)
I note that that appears to be the same split that you informed me of at around 12:25.
Civil Rights Litigation (42 U.S.C.

1.
He has advanced certifications and is an instructor at a local college, where he teaches topics including criminal investigation and law enforcement procedures.
His law enforcement career spans nearly 27 years, including previous roles with the Lillington Police Department in Harnett County, contract work with the Department of Defense, and instructing on forensic evidence at the U.S. Special Operations Command (USASOC)​.
He also holds advanced law enforcement certifications and teaches basic law enforcement training, specializing in firearms and hazardous materials at Central Carolina Community College​.
He immediately left and went to the sheriff’s office, arriving around 5:40 PM.
He arrived at the office around 5:40 PM and was briefed by Officer Haines, who provided preliminary information regarding Deal's statement.
This recording was later saved as evidence and designated State’s Exhibit 71​.
This video, marked State’s Exhibit 54, was timestamped at 3:42 AM.
Interview with Benjamin Allen:
On October 19, 2019, Benjamin Allen voluntarily came to the Lee County Sheriff’s Office.
This DNA sample was later entered as evidence under State’s Exhibit 77 and secured to be sent to the State Bureau of Investigation (SBI) lab for analysis​.
He received verbal permission from Mr. Allen to retrieve the items from the porch without specifying what items he had a deputy retrieve.
These items were logged into the sheriff’s office evidence system and submitted to the SBI lab​.
This was later processed securely before being sent to the SBI lab.

This discrepancy suggests they may have stayed at CCH longer than reported, during which time hospital staff could have contacted law enforcement.
These records are public documents and should be available to ensure transparency in law enforcement’s response and hospital reporting practices.
Request for Discovery and Subpoenas:
The defense could request a discovery motion to access all 911 records, incident reports, and hospital documentation related to Deal’s visit to CCH that night.

Bruh.
I sit for too long trying to figure out NLP and NER type shit to process data but have learned a lot.
If I ever thought I would use stuff like Cytoscape and Gephi again I would probably feel better.
I will absolutely have to send it your way when I am mostly done.
Gonne lock down all weekend to try to get most of it done so I can go fishing!
I am learning a bit about AI though.
I have this note app that is powered by AI.
I just ask about my notes and BAM.
This tool called DocFetcher is like the old school Google Desktop.
DNA expert received incomplete or late materials from the ADA.
The delay spanned over three years, well beyond COVID disruptions.
Application:
Applying the Barker test:
Length: Over 3 years – presumptively prejudicial.
This also meets the threshold in State v. Pippin, 72 N.C. App.
Discovery submitted mid-trial.
ADA failed to communicate with defense or respond to repeated inquiries​.
Civil Rights Litigation (42 U.S.C.
Peter West III (his father) works for the Sheriff's Department, doing transportation for the jail.
Peter West was a building inspector for the local government.
Peter West is friends with Steven Money, the magistrate who signed the search warrant.
James Morrison has worked for the city government since 2010.
James Morrison had "similar connections as Peter West within the Lee County justice system."
Loss of Phone Data: For $5,000, the firm was entrusted with extracting data from a phone containing potentially exculpatory information, but both the phone and the extracted data have been irretrievably lost.
Detailed Manipulations: 
Consistent use of full names ("Ben Allen" vs. "Ben") to enhance formality.
Restructuring the narrative for improved flow and coherence.
2023: Medical records requested; not provided until trial in 2023.
Over 4 Years, 37 Continuances: Case delayed excessively, causing prejudice (e.g., lost evidence, financial harm to Allen as a single father).
July 2023, Deliberations: Jury hung; alternate substituted; Allen charge given.
No retrial pursued to date (as of January 15, 2026).
This subverts the judicial safeguards established by Beck v. Ohio, 379 U.S. 89 (1964), and Franks v. Delaware, 438 U.S. 154 (1978).

Footnotes
Based on case file transcripts and witness statements.
Integrated from new document on undisclosed ties.
Rushed charging from the timeline.
Familial bias from Enclosure 1 and new doc.
Procedural lapses from transcripts.
Statement reliability from Enclosure 1.
Ineffectiveness under Strickland.
The request was entered on Dec 9th, 2019.
The ADA, my attorneys, and the judge had to track them down the day of court.
I told my attorney that this was impossible.
The ADA, my attorneys, and the judge sat down to discuss.
The ADA was informed that the expert had a set time to leave because he had surgery scheduled.
The ADA said that there would be plenty of time before then.
Even with the expert being provided, I was still disadvantaged.
I asked my attorneys if they had billed me for time working on the DNA.
I told them I didn’t have any additional resources to spend.
My job was taken
away once I was charged.
How was their time being taken away from other avenues of my defense not a disadvantage for me?
The ADA continually delayed turning over documents such as medical records.
A search warrant was served to retrieve an item from my property even after my attorney was informed that it was there, and I was told that the ADA would be contacted to retrieve it.
Other trash from the back of my vehicle was represented
as something nefarious, even though they never bothered to retrieve the trash that had been saved for them from the residence or took the trash they tried to represent as evidence.
My attorneys never addressed this, even though I repeatedly sent the property overview and asked where she ran to.
One of the gentleman's father works with the police department.
The other also works in some capacity for the city.
A request to retrieve all email communications and telephone calls from this time period would be appropriate.
The second lesser included charge, the vote was 9-3, both in favor of acquittal.
The ADA wants to retry me since they are corrupt.
He has understanding Of elements outside of what he was assigned.
The elements that I named important Were those that were outside, the scope that he was assigned.
Was outside of regular guidelines For how.
And how it was implemented.
That was displayed by both the prosecutor's office And the detective An officer From Lee County Sheriff's Department.
None of these Follow any recommendation from any department That exists within the United States.
We have a mother and Tiffany Allen Who has and would do anything for custody of her children.
That put to put in place To manage this case.
So while there was a huge expenditure, not only on the part of Mr. Allen, but of the state, in this previous case, None Resources, We're utilized.
To take the extortion To the Lee County.
Sheriff's Office Is puzzling, Mr. Allen was to believe that he had at least spoken with someone At the district attorney's office In which to clarify On how to proceed.
It was mentioned to Mr. Allen.
So, the accused Civil rights for all those American citizens In which we're all entitled To these rights that are bestowed on us by God.
In this case, 

In America, This shouldn't have mattered, But as we can see, Sanford isn't like America.
It is weighed By the numbers In your cell phone.
The importance of the elements in which I was advising him to undertake.
They're both observation and discussion.
And what I can't wrap my mind around, It's the favor they are asking for Is to take a father away from his children.
A single father, Who is the only income for that household?
Whose job provides the insurance that they need to stay healthy, The dental insurance To ensure they can get braces on their teeth.
Or how about and the vision insurance That will help them.
See, Just like I hope this court sees.
This is not What a community pays for.
When we ask For law enforcement to be in our communities, Respect and admiration should be given to those Who give themselves To protect their communities.
Service to one's country is respected, And service.
Just as highly, But just as there's a standard of conduct That governed My client's behavior.
And it's time in the Marine Corps.
It was a standard to, which he was held And he maintained We cannot say the same thing about those Representatives.
In this case, the representatives Of the community, in this case, The behaviors Of Ada, Tiffany Bartholomew And detective, Stephen Freeman.
They It they don't only violate The long-standing Traditions of our country and the Constitution.
Having the ability To do this to another human.
Cannot even be characterized by something like beyond the Pale.
It's unthinkable, and it's almost unimaginable that those that are holding Those position of power and authority within our communities.
Those that we've given so much trust And 

So much trust and treasure For them to use that power To attack that very Community Is reprehensible And it isn't just for Mr. Allen that I say this.
What should have been recognized up?
This craft will help was there for a reason.

Introduction 
I wanted to start a little better than I did with my last attorney.
Even on the last day of court, he still called me a contractor.
I will attempt to communicate more effectively to ensure that I am not wasting your time looking through materials to ascertain answers that I should have provided upfront.

SCI clearance investigations involve an additional screening process.
Not everyone with a Top Secret (TS) clearance has SCI access.
You are only eligible for SCI screening if specific duties require access to this information.
This required Single Scope Background Investigations, which are extensive background checks and investigation processes that can take several months or even years to complete.
A single-scope background investigation (SSBI) is the most comprehensive investigation that the government can conduct, in addition to interviews and reviews of financial, criminal, and medical records.
It is designed to assess honesty and integrity by measuring various physiological responses while answering several questions.
I also held additional clearance levels reserved for individuals requiring access to sensitive or compartmented information.
These include Special Access Programs (SAP) created for specific government projects or programs requiring additional screening.
These Control System caveats included GAMMA, TALENT KEYHOLE, HUMINT, and SI.
SI / GAMMA - This sub-control system of SI is for highly sensitive communication intercepts (product or content) * and, therefore, requires the ORCON dissemination marking.
GAMMA may contain compartments identified by a codeword or an identifier of four alphabetic characters.
HUMINT/HCS -This control system is intended to provide enhanced protection to exceptionally fragile clandestine HUMINT sources, methods, and activities based on assessed value, critical nature, and information vulnerability.
TALENT KEYHOLE – Covers space-based IMINT (imagery intelligence), SIGINT (signals intelligence), and MASINT (measurement and signature intelligence) collection platforms; related processing and analysis techniques; and research, design, and operation of these platforms.

FAMILY BACKGROUND
I was told by my first attorney (Frank Collins) that this would never have been tried if it hadn’t been for statements made by Tiffany Allen.
We have a long history in the Family Courts in Lee County.
I turned the phone over to my attorney.
It was misplaced during the transition between lawyers in the firm after the State asked for 37 continuances.
I am unable to work due to the requirements placed on me by the government, so the ADA used this to drain my resources.
I am a single father struggling to support two children with no income.
I still had the examples I sent to my first attorney, but that is all.
I will include snapshots that I sent to my first attorney.
I would pass over the phone and data, but this was misplaced by my attorneys at some point over the past few years.

He is a building inspector for the local government.
His father works with the police department.
The request was entered on Dec 9th, 2019.
The ADA, my attorneys, and the judge had to track them down the day of court.
I told my attorney that this was impossible.
The ADA, my attorneys, and the judge sat down to discuss.
The ADA was informed that the expert had a set time to leave because he had surgery scheduled.
The ADA said that there would be plenty of time before then.
Even with the expert being provided, I was still disadvantaged.
I asked my attorneys if they had billed me for time working on the DNA.
I told them I didn’t have any additional resources to spend.
My job was taken away once I was charged.
How was their time being taken away from other avenues of my defense not a disadvantage for me?
The ADA continually delayed turning over documents such as medical records.
A search warrant was served to retrieve an item from my property even after my attorney was informed that it was there, and I was told that the ADA would be contacted to retrieve it.
Other trash from the back of my vehicle was represented as something nefarious, even though they never bothered to retrieve the trash that had been saved for them from the residence or took the trash they tried to represent as evidence.
My attorneys never addressed this, even though I repeatedly sent the property overview and asked where she ran to.
One of the gentleman's father works with the police department.
The other also works in some capacity for the city.
A request to retrieve all email communications and telephone calls from this time period would be appropriate.
The second lesser included charge, the vote was 9-3, both in favor of acquittal.

## [PROPOSAL] STRATEGIC THEME 5
- **Evidence Count**: 991 items linked
- **Key Identifiers**: 
- **Thematic Summary**: The defendant did not object to any of  the challenged comments at trial.
Clark testified that the case had received extensive pretrial publicity in Pitt County, some of  which focused on Bradford's  claim at his trial that defendant was the most  culpable  perpetrator  of  the  crimes.
The  trial  court  denied defendant's  renewed  motion but  did  allow  individual questioning  of jurors  on the issue of pretrial publicity.
He  also stated that he would be very lenient  in  allowing challenges for cause if  any of  the jurors disclosed  that  they  had  been  exposed  to details  from  the  Bradford trial placing the blame for the crimes on defendant.
2d 420 (1961).Nor may he place before the jury evidence whose only effect is to excite prejudice or sympathy.
According to the report, by the National Registry of Exonerations, official misconduct contributed to false convictions in 54 percent of exonerations, usually with more than one type of misconduct.
Here, there is no allegation or even intimation that the district attorney had deliberately employed any “unjustifiable standard” in calendaring this or any other case involving the death penalty.
The record does not disclose what event initiated the State’s further investigation of the case in 1981.
Apart from a statement made to law enforcement authorities by Larry Lumsden, there was, in 1975, no other evidence to connect this defendant to the crime.
Defendant’s inculpatory statements to Wiley, Hamilton, and Adams were not disclosed until 1981.
Ms. Current was not interviewed until 1981.
We can only speculate that defendant was perhaps a suspect in Í975, and due to the persistent efforts of law enforcement authorities, some inculpatory evidence was uncovered which ultimately led police to witnesses Wiley, Hamilton, Adams and Current in 1981.
Paragraph (C) does not apply to an accused appearing pro se with the approval of the tribunal.
Nor does it forbid the lawful questioning of a suspect who has knowingly waived the rights to counsel and silence.
(6) Participate in the creation or preservation of evidence when he knows or it is obvious that the evidence is false.
There are circumstances where failure to make a disclosure is the equivalent of an affirmative misrepresentation.
When evidence that a lawyer knows to be false is provided by a person who is not the client, the lawyer must refuse to offer it regardless of the client’s wishes.
Upon ascertaining that material evidence is false, the lawyer should seek to persuade the client that the evidence should not be offered or, if it has been offered, that its false character should immediately be disclosed.
Prejudice 
There was no error change in venire where a Baker, 34.
We believe, however, that a witness’s omission of certain facts  due  to  prosecutorial  instruction  renders  the  witness’s  entire  testimony  inherently  not  credible.
Thus,  the  pertinent  question  during  further  postconviction  proceedings  is  not  whether  Hammond’s testimony  is  credible  (infra 25)  but,  instead,  whether  Hammond’s  allegations  contained  within  his affidavit are actually true.
Additionally, questions concerning the reliability of a witness’s testimony are not to be decided at the first stage of postconviction proceedings, but 2Again, we remind the State that Hammond’s failure to specifically articulate what exactly he would have testified to at trial does not justify dismissal at first stage.
Omission  of  said  facts  was  extremely prejudicial to defendant’s claim of justification or a finding of murder in a lesser degree at trial.
It was premature and inappropriate for the majority to reach such a conclusion in this case.
Failing to disclose medical or forensic evidence likely to prove exculpatory Knowing but not disclosing that the detective who took the defendant’s confession had previously taken one or more proven false confessions Attempting to introduce inadmissible and prejudicial evidence known to be inadmissible.
ADA opening statements asked jury if they could convict based solely on circumstantial evidence.
Willfully ignored evidence Familiarity with methods and people under investigation that can bias either the evidence and/or conclusions; Cognitive bias, where someone’s reality and the information they come across is colored by his or her preconceived notions; and Intimidation, whether through coercion or pressure.
Confirmation Bias Another type of implicit bias, confirmation bias, is also something we all do without realizing it.
For example, if you are investigating a claim of sexual harassment in the workplace and the complaint shines a very negative light on the alleged perpetrator, you might unconsciously begin the investigation looking for evidence that he/she engaged in sexual harassment.
Include statement of Roger saying he hopes that I convicted.
Victims are not guaranteed any type of criminal investigation will occur when they report a crime or suspicious behavior.
Failure to properly collect evidence related to the case.
Failure to interview witnesses.
Not storing the evidence properly where no one unauthorized has access.
Not properly documenting evidence with the crime scene info, date, and location of where evidence was collected.
ensurign it would create a prejeduce without rebuttal since the accusation was so severe while also being without any merit whatsoever.
The ADA nor the detective ever looked into the accusations included therin purposly to create this prejudice since if they did look into it then they would have to remove it as a matter of course.
Psychological Perspectives: Cognitive psychologists have examined how once information is known, it is challenging to "un-know" it, a phenomenon known as the "forbidden fruit effect."
This suggests that judges might struggle internally to set aside this information, even if they consciously acknowledge it as inadmissible.
An example of an improper commitment question (asked by the prosecutor in a drug case) would be the following:  “If the evidence, in a hypothetical case, showed that a person was arrested and he/she had in his/her pocket a crack pipe with residue in it, is there anyone who could not convict a person based on that?”  Standefer, 59 S.W.3d at 179.
Which did occur when it came time to address her offering me a plea deal under false pretenses.
The trial court found that there existed probable cause to remove Cline from office on 27 January 2012.
This motion cited personal illness and the inability of Cline to procure counsel  as  the  basis  for  the  motion.
On 17 February 2012, the trial court denied Cline’s motion to continue the hearing until the first Monday in March of 2012.
Names of the grand jurors’ to see if it also contained someone that was related to the case like on the jury during my trial.
Identify and interview key witnesses.

The credibility of a witness may be attacked by any party, including the party calling him.
Since there is no chain of custody for the hosptial video it needs to be excluded.
Defendant contends that there is no evidence that plaintiff was raped or sexually assaulted and that the use of these terms will unnecessarily confuse and inflame the jury."
The facts of this case were agreed upon but there is still logic here that applies.
The  court  went  on  t o  say  that  such a claim "would have waived  the attorney-client privilege entirely."
There are those occasions when a party feels that evidence which might be incompetent would be advantageous to him, therefore, he does not object.
The bedroom where Lauren alleged the incident happened was never combed for evidence.
(this would include the bed, the bed's sheets, blankets, the floor, Ben's bathroom, why was none of this evidence every collected at the scene where the rape was alleged to have occured) B. Ben's body was never examined for marks and nothing is noted (This would have been powerful evidence to demonstrate a violent struggle between Lauren and Ben) C. Two witnesses outside Ben's bedroom were interviewed about this case combined for about 15 minutes.
(These were key witnesses to this case) D. Ben's 12 year old daughter was never interviewed by enforcement.
E. Carmen Love was never interviewed by law enforcement.
(the woman at the bar all night with Lauren Deal, the night of the incident) F. In the first interview with Lauren Deal, the officer stated that Ben was guilty and would be punished to the fullest extent of the law.
(This was before Ben was ever even interviewed) G. There was never any testing done for Ben's semen (and this was an alleged first degree rape) 3.
This to me is one of the biggest points of this case, to show her mental state at the time Ben was alleged to have raped her.)
( At trial sherepeatedly said that Ben was not forward with her the whole night, leading up to the alleged rape) "He is going to say he didn't do it."
The alleged rape lasted 2-3 minutes from start to finish.
(stated it lasted 1-2 minutes at the hospital) Do you remember a statement by Officer Hayes; when you were wondering if you should presscharges or not, a statement that he made about it was their job to prove he was guilty?
Not to investigate fairly orassume innocence but to prove that Mr. Allen was guilty?
(referred to alleged rape as sex ) never actually said rape until onthe stand at trial.
Maybe he jury knows someone that is in the militaryand it would be worth asking if anyone has heard anyone talk like that.
It is just moreexaggeration.
Lauren doesn't remember anything about what Ben was wearing while on the stand and never mentioned hisclothing to the police.
She also doesn't remember if the clothing came off during the alleged rape, and makesno mention of this 4 years earlier to the police.
In police interviews, the only dialogue is him refusing to turn around.
In video andeven in this courtroom, Mr. Allen can't shut his mouth but he did during this event?
If Mr. Allen had justdeployed isn't he required to be tested for HIV?
-Just like the video maybe mention that one first and go through it would she maintain her testimony if therewas evidence to the contrary?
You never state that there is evidence, just ifshe would change her testimony.
We never got into testimony about the friction that would have occurred which would have led to a massiveamount of DNA.
Instead of them using a test that wouldn't be accepted for a child support check they shouldhave had enough DNA to pinpoint exactly who a person was with a high level of confidence, Especially sinceshe was seen so rapidly.
I was not read their Miranda rights at any time while detained and interrogated.
He mispoke during his testimony.
Application: The detective's undisclosed relationship with a witness could represent a conflict of interest, potentially biasing the investigation and affecting its integrity.
The existence  of  pretrial  publicity  by  itself  does not  establish a  reasonable likelihood that defendant cannot receive a fair trial in the county where the crime was committed.
While the information submitted by the defendant indicated that this case had been the subject of pretrial publicity  which  had  aroused  some  controversy  in  the  community, defendant  made  no  showing  that  any  of  the  prospective  jurors  in Forsyth  County  would  be  unable  to set aside this pretrial publicity and decide this case solely on the evidence presented at trial.
The trial court was not required to make findings of  fact or conclusions of  law in connection with the denial of this pretrial  motion.
The transcript clearly shows that the trial court's  ruling did not prohibit defendant from renewing this motion if the actual jury v o i r  dire had revealed such prejudice against him.
A review of the actual v o i r  dire of prospective jurors reveals that the trial  court did not err by  denying defendant's pretrial motion for change of  venue.
First, defendant failed to use all of  his peremptory challenges.
When the actual jury  was seated, defendant still had  one unused peremptory challenge remaining.
Further, defendant made no showing during this voir dire that  it  was  reasonably  likely  that the jurors  in his case would  base their decision on the pretrial publicity rather than on the information presented at trial.
Since the Detective knew that his lack of honesty, condor or completing any function that would constitute an investigation could only the defendant he chose not to conduct them.
ln previewing  the  evidence, counsel  generally  should  not  (1)  refer  to  inadmissible  evidence, (2) 'exaggerate or overstate' the evidence, or (3) discuss evidence he expects the other party to introduce."
We  conclude that the remark of the prosecutor  did  not violate  any  of  these principles.
The prosecutor's statement did not go beyond the proper scope and function of an opening statement.
Therefore, the trial court did not err in overruling defendant's objection.
The defendant did not object to any of the challenged comments at trial.

Which did occur when it
came

The trial court found that there existed probable cause to
remove
Cline from office on 27 January 2012.
This motion cited personal
illness
and the inability of Cline to procure counsel as the basis for the motion.
On 17 February 2012, the trial court denied Cline’s motion to continue
the
hearing until the first Monday in March of 2012.

Defendant contends that there is no evidence
that
plaintiff was raped or sexually assaulted and that the use of these terms will
unnecessarily
confuse and inflame the jury."
The
facts
of this case were agreed upon but there is still logic here that applies.
The court went on t o say that such a claim "would have waived the
attorneyclient
privilege entirely."
There are those
occasions
when a party feels that evidence which might be incompetent would be
advantageous
to him, therefore, he does not object.
The bedroom where Lauren alleged the incident happened
was
never combed for evidence.
(this would
include
the bed, the bed's sheets, blankets, the floor, Ben's bathroom, why was none of
this
evidence every collected at the scene where the rape was alleged to have
occured)
B. Ben's body was never examined for marks and nothing is noted (This would
have
been powerful evidence to demonstrate a violent struggle between Lauren and
Ben)
C. Two witnesses outside Ben's bedroom were interviewed about this case
combined
for about 15 minutes.
(These were key witnesses to this case) D. Ben's 12 year
old
daughter was never interviewed by enforcement.
E. Carmen Love was never interviewed by law enforcement.
(the woman at
the
bar all night with Lauren Deal, the night of the incident) F. In the first
interview
with Lauren Deal, the officer stated that Ben was guilty and would be punished
to
the fullest extent of the law.
(This was before Ben was ever even interviewed)
G.
There was never any testing done for Ben's semen (and this was an alleged first
degree
rape) 3.
This to me is one of the biggest
points
of this case, to show her mental state at the time Ben was alleged to have
raped
her.)
( At trial sherepeatedly said that Ben was not forward with her the
whole
night, leading up to the alleged rape) "He is going to say he didn't do it."
The alleged rape lasted 23 minutes from
start
to finish.
(stated it lasted 12 minutes at the hospital) Do you remember a
statement
by Officer Hayes; when you were wondering if you should presscharges or not, a
statement
that he made about it was their job to prove he was guilty?
Not to investigate
fairly
orassume innocence but to prove that Mr. Allen was guilty?
(referred to alleged
rape
as sex ) never actually said rape until onthe stand at trial.
Maybe he jury
knows
someone that is in the militaryand it would be worth asking if anyone has heard
anyone
talk like that.
It is
just
moreexaggeration.
Lauren
doesn't
remember anything about what Ben was wearing while on the stand and never
mentioned
hisclothing to the police.
She also doesn't remember if the clothing came off
during
the alleged rape, and makesno mention of this 4 years earlier to the police.
In police interviews, the only
dialogue
is him refusing to turn around.
In video andeven in this courtroom, Mr. Allen
can't
shut his mouth but he did during this event?
If Mr. Allen had
justdeployed
isn't he required to be tested for HIV?
Just like the video maybe mention that
one

to
the contrary?
You never state that there is evidence, just ifshe would change her testimony.
We never
got
into testimony about the friction that would have occurred which would have led
to
a massiveamount of DNA.
Instead of them using a test that wouldn't be accepted
for
a child support check they shouldhave had enough DNA to pinpoint exactly who a
person
was with a high level of confidence, Especially sinceshe was seen so rapidly.
I was not read their Miranda rights at any time while

He mispoke during his testimony.
Application The detective's
undisclosed
relationship with a witness could represent a conflict of interest, potentially
biasing
the investigation and affecting its integrity.
I was not allowed to leave despite requesting to do so and was held without
clear
legal justification.
The
existence of pretrial publicity by itself does not establish a reasonable
likelihood
that defendant cannot receive a fair trial in the county where the crime was
committed.
While the information submitted
by
the defendant indicated that this case had been the subject of pretrial
publicity
which had aroused some controversy in the community, defendant made no showing
that
any of the prospective jurors in Forsyth County would be unable to set aside
this
pretrial publicity and decide this case solely on the evidence presented at
trial.
The trial court was not required to make findings of fact or conclusions of law
in
connection with the denial of this pretrial motion.
The transcript clearly
shows
that the trial court's ruling did not prohibit defendant from renewing this
motion
if the actual jury v o i r dire had revealed such prejudice against him.
A
review
of the actual v o i r dire of prospective jurors reveals that the trial court
did
not err by denying defendant's pretrial motion for change of venue.
First,
defendant
failed to use all of his peremptory challenges.
When the actual jury was
seated,
defendant still had one unused peremptory challenge remaining.
Further,
defendant
made no showing during this voir dire that it was reasonably likely that the
jurors
in his case would base their decision on the pretrial publicity rather than on
the
information presented at trial.
Since the Detective
knew
that his lack of honesty, condor or completing any function that would
constitute
an investigation could only the defendant he chose not to conduct them.
ln previewing the evidence, counsel
generally
should not (1) refer to inadmissible evidence, (2) 'exaggerate or overstate'
the
evidence, or (3) discuss evidence he expects the other party to introduce."
We conclude that the remark
of
the prosecutor did not violate any of these principles.
The prosecutor's
statement
did not go beyond the proper scope and function of an opening statement.
Therefore,
the trial court did not err in overruling defendant's objection.

Witness Credibility and Relationships


Carmen Love's Testimony: Carmen Love, who is a cousin of the accuser, Lauren Deal, expressed in her interview that she was a survivor of domestic violence and rape but insisted she was non-biased.
Law enforcement took her statements seriously without sufficient scrutiny, potentially biasing the investigation against Ben.
For example, Tiffany's claims about Ben's character and behavior were not corroborated by evidence, yet they influenced Ben's perception during the investigation.
Inconsistencies in Lauren Deal's Statements


Contradictory Accounts: Lauren's statements about the alleged assault are inconsistent.
In her police interviews, she indicated that the incident lasted 2-3 minutes and described being held down.
However, at trial, she mentioned that she was unsure of the duration and implied it might have been shorter.
Additionally, she stated that she had bruises on her arms, but these were not visible in the interrogation video or photographs taken at the hospital.
This raises questions about the accuracy of her claims and her reliability as a witness.
The documents indicate that he did not secure bed linens or other potential exculpatory evidence, which could have provided crucial information regarding the alleged assault.
Instead, he opted only to take photographs of the scene, which is insufficient for a thorough investigation.
Witness Interviews: Law enforcement did not interview key witnesses, such as Carmen Love.
Potential for Coercion and Manipulation


Extortion Attempt: The documentation mentions an attempted extortion of $150,000, which was not investigated by law enforcement.
The fact that this extortion was not pursued suggests a failure in the investigative process and may indicate that the charges were influenced by ulterior motives.
Pressure to Plead: The Assistant District Attorney (ADA), Tiffany Bartholomew, allegedly used misleading statements about DNA evidence to pressure Ben into accepting a plea deal.
For example, she claimed to have his sperm and insisted that he should take a plea deal, which Ben knew to be false.
Physical Evidence and Forensic Analysis


DNA Evidence : The absence of DNA evidence linking Ben to the alleged assault is critical.
The documents indicate that Ben willingly provided his DNA, yet no other men who were with Lauren that night were asked for DNA samples.
Medical Examination : The lack of visible injuries or bruising on Lauren, as well as the absence of a thorough medical examination, calls into question the validity of her claims.
The documents state that medical records were subpoenaed multiple times but were not available on the first day of trial, further complicating the prosecution's case.
Timeline Reconstruction


Discrepancies in Timing : The timeline of events as recounted by various witnesses does not align.
A detailed reconstruction of the timeline based on verifiable evidence is essential to clarify these inconsistencies.
The documents indicate that the detective's prior false testimony was not disclosed, which could provide grounds for dismissing the case or excluding certain evidence.
For example, Carmen's testimony about Lauren's behavior and interactions with Ben is inconsistent with other witnesses' accounts, which could be used to undermine her credibility.
Conclusion
The case against Benjamin S. Allen is riddled with inconsistencies, questionable witness credibility, and significant investigative shortcomings.
There is also a required polygraph.
They should have told me immediately about the accusations she was making.
The allegations she made should have been relayed to me so that I could have restricted her access to the kids until she either recovered or managed contact under supervision, as was the court's direction during our custody case.
If law enforcement had done the slightest amount of investigation, they would have discovered the compromising situation my children were placed in and should have notified me of her accusations so that previous court requirements could have been reinstated for the protection of my children.

Investigation and Trial
There was no hope that this case would be dismissed once I refused to be bribed.
The bribe was never presented to the court, but I turned over the text messages to my attorneys as soon as it happened.
My attorneys didn’t dispute the prosecutorial misconduct when I was offered a plea deal using false information.
We were told that my sperm and DNA were found and that I was done, so I should just accept the plea.
Instead of confronting the ADA, he requested that the court pay for a DNA expert.
The ADA later admitted she made a mistake.
This only came out because I refused to return to the courtroom.
No one was looking out for my interest, and my attorneys let the ADA abuse her authority.
It was the only way I knew to force my attorneys to handle the situation.
The ADA said it was an honest mistake, and the judge said it didn’t prejudice my case since the court paid for a DNA expert.
A DNA expert who didn’t even get to testify due to the ADA pushing her time, ensuring he would already be gone.
If she offered me that plea as an honest mistake, was the same misrepresentation of the evidence provided to the grand jury?
She missed deadlines without concern and failed to follow through on document production, forcing additional delays.
I could not present a reasonable defense because evidence was lost during these forced delays.
This was never brought up during my trial.
The prosecution was allowed to present the evidence as if I was trying to hide it.
The attorney to whom I reported the item no longer represented me, so he could not handle this miscommunication in person or give a statement that no search warrant was required since he was to address it with the DA.
Even though he was with the same firm then, this wasn’t represented to the court during my trial.
The vast discrepancies between the conversations of the witnesses and the detective and the same witnesses and the private investigator were never brought up to the court.
Significant differences made it apparent that the statements made to the police and the private investigator were false.
The discrepancies in the accuser's statements on the stand were not addressed.
Once she testified, it should have been relatively easy to point out how ridiculous this route was if one was running for their life.
This could be combined with how she claimed the event occurred.
I asked my attorneys when we could press perjury charges since the statements about the event were not physiologically possible.
They also never asked about the hour gap in the timeline that was in the witness testimony.
The fact that the other gentlemen with Lauren Deal that night were not interviewed also leads one to suspect the investigation.
There was no concern to detail the night's events to ascertain a solid timeline.
The detective in charge of the investigation had many hours of investigative training.
He didn’t attempt to utilize any of that training to establish an investigation.
He also didn’t report that on the night he arrested me (after a four-hour investigation) he said he would work with the magistrate to get my bail lowered so I could go home.
I believe it was because he knew I didn’t do it but was told to carry out the arrest, which brings me to Brady violations.
It was said that more conversations occurred about this case with the detective.
They were not turned over in discovery.
One of the state's witnesses even testified in court to intimidation by the detective and the ADA while he was there to testify and over the phone during an interview.
This unjust prosecution was marked by many changes of the presiding judge, not allowing the Honorable Winston Gilchrist to have visibility of the repeated abuse of position by the ADA.
This didn’t allow my attorneys ample time for review to add to my defense.
The DNA specialist didn't get to testify due to a surgery he had scheduled.
As he departed, he told my mother that he had told the ADA in plenty of time, and she had told him he would be able to testify Thursday.
The ADA presented 95 pieces of evidence to the jury, the defense didn’t present a single piece of evidence, and yet the vote was 12-0 on the charge of 1st-degree rape.
When we returned to court on 31 October 2023, my attorney asked the ADA why she was pursuing another trial.
My attorney tried to tell her the actual count but eventually gave up as he said it was useless because she wouldn't listen.
This is just another example of how the truth doesn’t matter to anyone involved in this case.
The person who tried to bribe me is friends with all the parties involved, including the accuser's family and the police force.
Application to Scenario
Impact of Familial Relationship:
Basic Element: Witness credibility and potential conflict of interest.
Giglio v. United States | 405 U.S. 150 (1972)
Importance of witness credibility and prosecutorial disclosure.
Directly relates to the impact of a detective's familial relationship on witness testimony.
This relationship could have been used to impeach Carmen Love's testimony and challenge the integrity of the investigation.
Withholding of video evidence from Schooly's bar that contradicted witness statements.
This video evidence could have been used to challenge the credibility of multiple witnesses and potentially exonerate Mr. Allen.
Examples include:
Lauren Deal's testimony contradicting video evidence from the bar.
(Best v. Duke University, 337 N.C. 742, 448 S.E.2d 506 (1994))
The lack of thorough investigation, apparent bias, and potential fabrication of evidence suggest malice and lack of probable cause.
b) Mischaracterization of Witness Statements: The detective's report includes statements allegedly made by witnesses that are contradicted by their actual recorded statements.
c) False Representation of DNA Evidence: The ADA misrepresented the presence of Mr. Allen's DNA as evidence to pressure him into accepting a plea deal.
This omission is a fundamental flaw in the investigation.
b) Neglect of Physical Evidence: The detective did not collect crucial physical evidence from the alleged crime scene, such as bedsheets or other potential DNA sources.
c) Lack of Timeline Verification: The investigation failed to establish a coherent and verified timeline of events.
The discrepancies in the timeline, particularly the unaccounted hour, were not adequately investigated or explained.
e) Failure to Verify Accuser's Claims: The detective did not adequately verify Lauren Deal's claims about her movements after leaving Mr. Allen's house.
Additionally, we should consider how cognitive biases, such as confirmation bias and tunnel vision, might have influenced the course of this investigation.
Overlooked Techniques and Procedures:

a) Failure to Conduct a Proper Crime Scene Investigation:
Standard crime scene investigation procedures were not followed.
b) Lack of Forensic Analysis:
There's no indication that proper forensic analysis was conducted on the limited evidence that was collected.
This should have included:

DNA analysis of any biological evidence
Toxicology reports to corroborate or refute claims about intoxication levels
Analysis of clothing for transfer evidence

c) Failure to Establish a Comprehensive Timeline:
A detailed timeline of events, corroborated by cell phone records, surveillance footage, and witness statements, was not constructed.
d) Neglect of Electronic Evidence:
There's no indication that investigators sought to obtain or analyze electronic evidence such as:

Cell phone records and geolocation data
Social media activity
Text messages or other communications between involved parties

e) Lack of Follow-Up Interviews:
Key witnesses were not re-interviewed as new information came to light.
Follow-up interviews are crucial for clarifying inconsistencies and addressing new questions that arise during an investigation.
f) Failure to Use Cognitive Interview Techniques:
There's no evidence that cognitive interview techniques, which are known to elicit more accurate and detailed information from witnesses, were employed.
b) Physical Evidence: The lack of immediate physical evidence is striking:
No rape kit was performed immediately
No evidence was collected from the alleged crime scene
No visible injuries were documented on Lauren Deal or Ben Allen
This absence of physical evidence should have prompted a more thorough investigation before an arrest was made.
c) Witness Statements: The statements from other witnesses, particularly Joseph DeMarco and Steve Happel, were not fully consistent with Lauren Deal's account.
These discrepancies should have been resolved before determining probable cause.
d) Video Evidence: The existence of video evidence from Schooly's bar, which apparently contradicted some aspects of the accuser's story, was not considered in the probable cause determination.
Timeline Issues:
The timeline presented by Lauren Deal and corroborated by her mother is inconsistent with objective evidence, particularly the hospital video timestamp.
This discrepancy casts doubt on the entire narrative and should have been a red flag in the probable cause determination.
Lack of Corroboration:
The failure to corroborate key aspects of Lauren Deal's story before making an arrest is a significant flaw in the probable cause determination.
Ignoring Exculpatory Evidence:
The apparent dismissal of evidence that contradicted Lauren Deal's account, such as the video from Schooly's and the statements of other witnesses, is a serious breach of the duty to consider all available evidence in determining probable cause.
This failure to explore other possibilities undermines the validity of the probable cause determination.
Conclusion on Probable Cause:
Based on this analysis, it appears that the standard for probable cause was not met in the arrest of Ben Allen.
The investigation was rushed, key evidence was ignored or not sought, and potential biases were not accounted for.
The totality of the circumstances, when properly considered, does not support a reasonable belief that Mr. Allen committed the alleged crime.
I'll examine this through the lens of both an experienced attorney and detective, looking for key details that could justify or undermine probable cause.
Key Points from the Interview:
Ben Allen voluntarily came to the police station for questioning.
He expresses concern about potential neglect charges for not looking for Lauren in the woods.
In this interview, there's no direct admission of criminal conduct.
His concern about neglect charges suggests awareness something may have happened after leaving the bar, but he doesn't provide details about events at his house.
The interview alone does not appear to provide sufficient grounds for arrest on sexual assault charges.
A thorough review of the complete case file, including Lauren's statement and any physical evidence, would be necessary to make a definitive assessment of probable cause.
Transparency: The detective doesn't clearly communicate to Ben Allen that he's a suspect in a potential crime.
Voluntariness: While Allen came to the station voluntarily, the detective doesn't make it clear that Allen is free to leave at any time.
He's not fully respecting Allen's autonomy or right to informed consent in the interrogation process.
For instance, Gates was accused of [describe the incident], where [key events].
On 12/01/2014, the three older children denied that their father had touched them.
Mother was instructed by DSS not to take children to any more medical and/or mental health providers and that she should not talk about the case to the children and she should not talk about case in their presence.
Law enforcement was unable to listen to lengthy recording mother had made.
Recording was very unclear.
According to Dr. Matala in her CFE Report, the private detective believed that the recording was inconclusive for sexual abuse.
None of the children made disclosures of sexual abuse to Dr. Matala.
Children's  statements  different than disclosure to SW Anderson.
During investigation, Tiffany Allen has changed statements as to details in the case.
Sarah Allen had knowledge of family life because she spent approximately five weeks on and off with the family during the investigation

Investigation and Trial
Background of the one issue I will present.
After hearing the DNA experts for the state testify, I went outside to smoke.
I was pissed but it seemed that my attorneys hadn’t blinked an eye.
At no time did she have the evidence that she said she did.
The same evidence that I told you she was lying about because it was impossible.
You applied for an expert instead of calling out her misconduct, and you still didn’t do it when we were sitting in court.
The Assistant District Attorney (ADA) acknowledged, in the presence of a judge and two attorneys, that she offered me a plea deal based on a “misunderstanding” of the evidence.
The reason I laid out her qualifications above is due to this statement of misunderstanding the evidence.
This admission raises serious concerns: if the ADA was indeed mistaken about the evidence, it suggests that the same incorrect information was used to secure my indictment.
Alternatively, if there was no mistake about the evidence, the ADA's actions could constitute deceitful conduct, warranting sanctions.
She stated that the evidence against me was irrefutable.
She noted that the lab had identified my DNA / sperm, and the evidence of damage to the victim was obvious.
Neither of these things were true.
When he proffered the plea deal, I told my attorney that the lab had messed up or the ADA was lying.
Instead of confronting the ADA, my attorney requested a DNA expert.
I would not return to the courtroom during the trial until my attorneys addressed the issue.
The Assistant District Attorney, Tiffany Bartholomew, admitted in front of the Honorable Paul A. Holcombe that the basis of the plea agreement was predicated on false information.
The ADA admits to a mistake in her evaluation of the facts underlying the plea deal, and the judge's decision that it did not prejudice the case is significant.
The judge's decision that the ADA's error does not prejudice the case suggests that, in his view, the error did not significantly affect my ability to receive a fair trial.
I am concerned about whether the ADA and my attorneys provided him with the full context to enable him to make an informed decision.
When the defendant addressed the judge’s ruling with his attorneys and asked that consideration be placed on the expenditure of attorney fees to combat the falsehoods, Attorney Jason Wunsch said that it could reflect poorly on him, so he didn’t bring it up and didn’t want to address it further.
The presiding judge's ruling that the ADA's error did not prejudice the case is contentious, primarily because it is a straightforward method of prejudicing someone who does not have a job and no income.
She had already extended the case for years.
Framing the situation in this manner and using it to add an aggravating factor to force a plea and spinning mundane acts into a web of deceit can only lead one to believe that she must be removed from office.
There was no hope that this case would be dismissed once I refused to be bribed.
The bribe was never presented to the court, but I turned over the text messages to my attorneys as soon as it happened.
My attorneys didn’t dispute the prosecutorial misconduct when I was offered a plea deal using false information.
We were told that my sperm and DNA were found and that I was done, so I should just accept the plea.
Instead of confronting the ADA, he requested that the court pay for a DNA expert.
The ADA later admitted she made a mistake.
This only came out because I refused to return to the courtroom.
No one was looking out for my interest, and my attorneys let the ADA abuse her authority.
It was the only way I knew to force my attorneys to handle the situation.
The ADA said it was an honest mistake, and the judge said it didn’t prejudice my case since the court paid for a DNA expert.
A DNA expert who didn’t even get to testify due to the ADA pushing her time, ensuring he would already be gone.
If she offered me that plea as an honest mistake, was the same misrepresentation of the evidence provided to the grand jury?
She missed deadlines without concern and failed to follow through on document production, forcing additional delays.
I could not present a reasonable defense because evidence was lost during these forced delays.
This was never brought up during my trial.
The prosecution was allowed to present the evidence as if I was trying to hide it.
The attorney to whom I reported the item no longer represented me, so he could not handle this miscommunication in person or give a statement that no search warrant was required since he was to address it with the DA.
Even though he was with the same firm then, this wasn’t represented to the court during my trial.
The vast discrepancies between the conversations of the witnesses and the detective and the same witnesses and the private investigator were never brought up to the court.
Significant differences made it apparent that the statements made to the police and the private investigator were false.
The discrepancies in the accuser's statements on the stand were not addressed.
Once she testified, it should have been relatively easy to point out how ridiculous this route was if one was running for their life.
This could be combined with how she claimed the event occurred.
I asked my attorneys when we could press perjury charges since the statements about the event were not physiologically possible.
They also never asked about the hour gap in the timeline that was in the witness testimony.
The fact that the other gentlemen with Lauren Deal that night were not interviewed also leads one to suspect the investigation.
There was no concern to detail the night's events to ascertain a solid timeline.
The detective in charge of the investigation had many hours of investigative training.
He didn’t attempt to utilize any of that training to establish an investigation.
He also didn’t report that on the night he arrested me (after a four-hour investigation) he said he would work with the magistrate to get my bail lowered so I could go home.
I believe it was because he knew I didn’t do it but was told to carry out the arrest, which brings me to Brady violations.
It was said that more conversations occurred about this case with the detective.
They were not turned over in discovery.
One of the state's witnesses even testified in court to intimidation by the detective and the ADA while he was there to testify and over the phone during an interview.
This unjust prosecution was marked by many changes of the presiding judge, not allowing the Honorable Winston Gilchrist to have visibility of the repeated abuse of position by the ADA.
This didn’t allow my attorneys ample time for review to add to my defense.
The DNA specialist didn't get to testify due to a surgery he had scheduled.
As he departed, he told my mother that he had told the ADA in plenty of time, and she had told him he would be able to testify Thursday.
The ADA presented 95 pieces of evidence to the jury, the defense didn’t present a single piece of evidence, and yet the vote was 12-0 on the charge of 1st-degree rape.
When we returned to court on 31 October 2023, my attorney asked the ADA why she was pursuing another trial.
My attorney tried to tell her the actual count but eventually gave up as he said it was useless because she wouldn't listen.
This is just another example of how the truth doesn’t matter to anyone involved in this case.
The person who tried to bribe me is friends with all the parties involved, including the accuser's family and the police force.
Franks v. Delaware (False Statements in Probable-Cause Submissions)
False Statement: “At 2:00 a.m., Lauren told Carmen she was going with Ben.”
Materiality: The State uses this claim to assert coordinated, voluntary movement and continuity of company—critically shaping probable-cause inferences (e.g., identity of companions, opportunity, continuity, and alleged incapacitation narrative).
Validation: The 2:00 a.m. statement goes to the heart of who went where and with whom; it’s not collateral.
Knowledge: The prosecution knew of the 12:41 a.m. departure and failed to correct Deal’s testimony so Napue/Giglio is implicated.
Unbiased video footage backs this assessment.
It is a concerted effort to build a provably false narrative, as evidenced by video footage.
No one said they were sitting around a fire, and no one said that the defendant followed her inside.
Fact Note: Lauren Deal testified that the defendant never said a word to her.
That the defendant didn’t speak a single word.
Fact Note: The allegation was physically impossible, and any competent investigation should have recognized that immediately.
The scenario described was not just unlikely—it defied the fundamental limits of human ability.
To proceed in the face of such apparent impossibility is not diligence; it is willful disregard for the truth.
If true, and the hospital didn’t report the incident to law enforcement, this failure to report would constitute a felony.
Yet, at trial, the narrative shifted—now she was allegedly not treated there and instead went directly to UNC—a version flatly unsupported by the evidence.
This change was not born of confusion; it was a calculated omission.
He even falsified the timeline by misrepresenting the video’s metadata timestamp to obscure his presence at the hospital.
This was not mere negligence; it was a deliberate manipulation of the record to serve personal convenience and protect himself from scrutiny.
This wasn't the statement the defendant gave at all.
No one stated that the defendant walked in behind her.
The defendant was taken to the detective's office after exiting the interview room.
There was no officer at the door to make sure he didn’t leave.
He used his phone to text Steve Happel, saying he was told that he was charged with a crime and would need bail since he believed he was under arrest.
The bias in this case had a significant impact on all aspects of its handling, making the following answer he gives a lie.
-They would not have even attempted to follow through on this extortion attempt if it weren’t for the support they received from the state.
Lauren repeats the lie that when she saw the defendant, she ran up and hugged him.
They took a lot of pictures at the hospital
There were no pictures of this from the hospital

In court, she attributed any possible bruises to being pushed down and stated that these may have come from falling in the woods.
Impact: This suggests that her initial claim of bruises from being held down may have been inaccurate or exaggerated.
But he said something about it before and corrected himself.
As matter of fact, you were not here for the testimony where Ms. Deal told this jury that because he had not been forward and flirtatious, she trusted him, and that's why she went home with him.
You didn't hear that testimony, correct?
Q: But you were not here for the state when Ms. Deal testified that the only injuries she could possibly attribute to this alleged rape was being maybe
A: bruise on the front of her arm from when she got pushed down, correct?
Include Wunsch Statements from the trial about the medical records, and try to find the injury change
Q Now, during this 40-minute long interview, she stated to you that Mr. Allen was always forward with her, correct?
Q And you weren't in here for the testimony when Ms. Deal told this jury that Mr. Allen had never been forward with her, correct?
Q And you weren't here for the testimony that was said earlier by Ms. Deal that the night of October 19, or the night into the morning, that Mr. Allen had not been forward with her or flirtatious with her at all, correct?
You didn't hear that testimony, correct?
Q But you were not here for the state when Ms. Deal testified that the only injuries she could possibly attribute to this alleged rape was being maybe a bruise on the front of her arm from when she got pushed down, correct?
Why was this marked as only internal injuries if the detective observed external injuries.
Basis for suppression of statements and evidence obtained as fruits of an arrest without prior probable cause

Testimony
MS. BARTHOLOMEW: And what was your relationship like with Tiffany?
At that time, was she still married to the defendant?
There was an aggravating factof because it was claimed that I was in a position of trust.
The defendant was told that she was not allowed in the house because her brother had stole from Tiffany when they had come over before.
The prosecution used a single Facebook message to try and prove the aggravating factor by taking advantage of a position of trust since the defendant did not accept the plea deal.
[An off-the-record discussion was had at the bench]  
THE COURT:  All right.
[the jury exited the courtroom] 
THE COURT:  Let the record reflect the jurors are now back in the jury room.
We don't have that person here, and so your honor, we would object to this page being entered into evidence.
How many times would you say you had been to a bonfire at the defendant's residence?
Did the State “link this up” by testimony of a conversation prior to 1:49 p.m. on December 3, 2016, as the court required for Exhibit 4’s first page?
The judge asked for testimony that they had a discussion prior to 1:49 p.m. on Dec. 3.
Having the witness read a text that itself says “Remember when I said…” is not the same as independent testimony that the prior discussion occurred.
Additional defects that cut against reliability/authentication (Rule 901/403):
The court noted later pages suggest “another individual” (Matt) using Ben’s phone at 7:42 p.m. That raises identity/attribution risk; the court allowed only the first page if context linked it to Ben via prior discussion.
The content oddity: “on the 10th… It is tonight” in a Dec. 3 message is internally inconsistent without clarifying testimony.
That unresolved mismatch further counsels against finding the State met the conditional foundation.
Based on this record excerpt, the State did not meet the judge’s “link it up” requirement.
The elicited testimony never established—independently of the text’s self-referential phrase—that a prior conversation occurred before 1:49 p.m. on Dec. 3.
Overloaded With Favorable Implications
In one short answer, she manages to:
Cast DeMarco as noble and protective
Invoke a “similar trauma” backstory for his girlfriend (sympathy trigger)
Reinforce that she was in fear
Imply moral condemnation of the defendant
This kind of multi-layered persuasive payload in a single reply is often a sign of rehearsal — most uncoached witnesses don’t instinctively weave together sympathy, corroboration, and motive so tightly.
Precision of the “Exact Words” Claim
The “exact words were…” formula is often taught to witnesses to lend credibility.
Or there was no traumatic event, or both.
Mirror Alignment With Prosecution Theme
The sentiment “I was scared, he was scared, his girlfriend would be furious if he didn’t help me” dovetails perfectly with the prosecution’s theory that everyone around the accuser viewed the defendant as dangerous.
This alignment — without tangents, contradictions, or hesitations — suggests careful shaping before testimony.
ADA Bartholomew thinks she is a brilliant prosecutor.
Where she asserts skill, an observer can see it as just breaking her oath and being dishonest, being a cheat, and being a criminal.
She “outsmarts” the other attorneys when, in reality, they aren’t willing to disregard their ethics as easily as she has done.
He never took me before a magistrate.
I never saw a judge or a magistrate.
The main thing is - I have not seen anything that would have given him probable cause in either the phone calls or my interview.
I cannot find this video checked into evidence.
He talked to the accuser (he didn’t interview anyone – his questions were trash) then he talked to one of his family members – I mean witness, before calling the guys that had been at my house.
He never took me before a magistrate.
He never took me before a judge.
There are gaps and factual errors that he just brushed aside.
That is why the video time stamps at the bar, a map with driving directions and time, and the time stamps on the video her mother took bound the time in a way that witnesses' testimony cannot.
They tried to extort me for $150,000, but their own "evidence" is what makes the story they are telling so obviously false.
The only fact pattern that fits is what I said from the beginning.
It isn't possible because it is another example of questions a Detective would have asked to ascertain the veracity of eyewitness testimony.
There are multiple examples besides the one above that he should have picked up on as lies - but he had to already know that.
(This is important later)
In his testimony - Did you arrest anybody in connection with the rape Ms. Deal reported?
After the interview, proceeded to find the magistrate, gave probable cause, and the magistrate issued a warrant for Benjamin Allen.
What was this probable Cause?
He arrested me, fingerprinted me, then said he would talk to the magistrate about bail (getting it lowered), and then he left.
She is the one who stated to Tiffany that it didn't matter if I was guilty; she had already talked to her people at the sheriff's office, and I was going down even if I was innocent.
It echoes the officer that said it was their job to make sure I was guilty.
He did not bother to check a single piece of evidence he was given.
Her later interview with the Private Investigator is completely unhinged.
The evidence is to the contrary.
Why isn’t she charged with obstruction?
This should have led to allegations of bias in the investigation, undermining its integrity.
Impact: The defense could have argued that the investigation was compromised, possibly leading to a motion to dismiss evidence or the entire case.
The prosecution might need to reassign the case to another Detective to mitigate this issue if they continue to pursue it.
Relationship Between the Accuser and the Witness:
Legal Aspect: The familial relationship between the accuser and the witness (cousins) doesn't inherently discredit the witness's testimony but could be portrayed as a source of bias.
Impact: The defense could have used this relationship to challenge the witness's credibility, suggesting they might be inclined to support the accuser regardless of the facts.
The selective focus on inconsistencies that strengthen the accusations while not interviewing two other possible witnesses because one was dating Ms. Love, the other was her friend, and an employee of the county goes beyond creating questions of investigative integrity.
It raises questions about the motives and credibility of the accuser's claims.
The defense might have used this to suggest that the assault claim was part of a scheme to extract money from the defendant.
The defendant's defense attorney refused even to mention the extortion scheme that was used against his client.
The relationship between the Detective and the witness should have been disclosed, and steps should have been taken to ensure an impartial investigation.
The defendant’s private investigator was told not to plan an attempt to uncover the scheme further.
This decision was made by the defendant's attorney without consulting his client.
The defendant began questioning why the extortion wasn’t exposed to the court or law enforcement.
Disclosure and Transparency: Full disclosure of the familial relationships and criminal actions that underpin this case should have been exposed to the court.
Reevaluation of the Case: The prosecution may need to reevaluate the strength of the case considering these developments of she wasn’t already aware of them.
The report meticulously outlines instances that suggest a preconceived narrative of guilt rather than an impartial pursuit of truth, underscoring the severity of the situation.
These interviews presented stark inconsistencies.
Her initial interview omitted any mention of assault and focused solely on social interactions.
Carmen stated that she had never heard the defendant’s name.
It was not explained how the detective utilized her statements as part of his probable cause, since she had never even heard his name, even though that is what he testified to during the trial.
Selective Witness Interviewing: The intentional failure to interview Peter West and James Morrison, individuals present with the accuser on the night in question and possessing potentially exculpatory information, is not just negligent, but strategically harmful to a fair investigation.
The omission of these witnesses suggests a deliberate attempt to control the narrative and suppress potentially contradictory evidence, further highlighting the injustice.
His claim to have "processed" the crime scene while admitting to taking no DNA, fingerprint, or biological samples beyond mere photographs is a blatant misrepresentation.
These are not minor discrepancies, but material misrepresentations used to secure a search warrant.
These false statements concealed the weakness of the prosecution's case and suppressed information favorable to the defense.
The false representation of witness statements was found only after careful review of audio recordings.
Furthermore, the failure to disclose the familial relationship with Carmen Love is a Brady violation, as it constitutes impeachment evidence directly relevant to witness credibility.
The fact that her subpoena was not enforced confirms the belief that her untruthful statements could not stand against any sort of examination of the facts.
Conflicting Accounts and Delayed Hospital Transfer Inconsistencies in Testimony: Lauren Deal and her mother’s account of leaving CCH immediately for another hospital conflicts with testimony indicating they waited for someone to bring them personal items from nearly an hour away.
This discrepancy shows they stayed at CCH longer than reported, during which time hospital staff would have contacted law enforcement.
This conflicting narrative undermines the credibility of Deal’s and her mother’s testimony, raising questions about what transpired during their time at CCH.
Law enforcement's arrival at CCH contradicts the narrative presented by Deal and her mother, indicating that additional undisclosed events or agreements may have influenced the case’s initial handling.
Implications for Law Enforcement Involvement: Law enforcement was contacted upon Deal’s arrival at CCH, and a decision was made not to record or investigate the report at that time.
Potential Legal Violations and Obstruction of Justice
Withholding 911 Records and Reports:
The refusal to provide 911 records or incident reports for that night is concerning.
This lack of transparency raises suspicion and shows that evidence of the hospital’s and law enforcement’s initial response is being deliberately concealed.
Misrepresentation of DNA Evidence: The ADA's misrepresentation of DNA evidence and injury to the accuser during plea negotiations, falsely claiming the defendant's sperm was found and clear physical injury, is a blatant act of prosecutorial misconduct.
Cross-Examination Deficiencies:  The defense attorneys' alleged failure to cross-examine key witnesses effectively, particularly regarding inconsistencies and potential biases, represents a significant dereliction of duty.
Furthermore, the failure to adequately investigate extortion claims, which could have provided exculpatory evidence or revealed alternative motives, demonstrates a lack of diligence and advocacy.
For the record, it says "your honor, we unanimously agree defendant is not guilty of first-degree forcible rape.
This note explicitly stated, "your honor, we unanimously agree defendant is not guilty of first-degree forcible rape."
In this case, that tribunal reached a definitive conclusion of not guilty regarding the first-degree rape charge.
Given this expertise, his actions and omissions should be viewed with an understanding that he likely knew the standard requirements yet chose specific approaches in this investigation that appear to deviate from standard protocol.
However, the timestamp is questionable.
The defendant still hasn’t seen the messages from Carmen Love.
This video falsely verifies aspects of Deal’s story while ignoring all instances that showed that the accuser committed perjury.
The pants were seized and logged into evidence.
Still, they were not sent to the crime lab.
This suggests he was aware he was under suspicion and that legal actions were in process.
In legal proceedings, the defense could argue that this omission deprived Allen of his Fourth Amendment rights, as he was detained without a clear, documented basis.
This doubt cast a shadow over his testimony, particularly if the defense argues that he knowingly avoided documentation to circumvent procedural scrutiny.
It shows significant disregard for standard protocols, raising serious questions about his methods and tainting the investigation.
However, verbal assertions without supporting documentation do not meet procedural standards and fail to provide a reliable, reviewable record.
It raises questions about the standard procedures he followed and testified to in this case.
His familiarity with both should have allowed him to recognize and clearly articulate this distinction during his testimony.
His testimony avoidance is an attempt to evade admitting procedural missteps.
The defense could argue that this omission suggests a pattern of neglecting legal protocols, which might prompt further investigation into other areas of the case.
His failure to follow these steps suggests either an intentional bypass of procedure or a significant oversight.
However, this is inconsistent with his professional knowledge, implying that the deviation was either deliberate or based on a disregard for protocol.
However, the lack of clarity in his responses still raises questions about whether he understood the retrospective order as a form of procedural cover, despite knowing it bypassed the usual review process.
Given his role as an instructor, this omission seems unlikely to be unintentional and may indicate an awareness of procedural shortcuts.
Evidence as Objective Corroboration: Unlike testimonial evidence, which can be subjective or challenged based on credibility, physical evidence provides objective data that can confirm or contradict witness statements or suspects’ claims.
This record is essential to establishing that the evidence remained unaltered and that all handling was conducted according to protocol.
This omission could raise questions about whether the evidence was consistently handled according to protocol, making it vulnerable to defense scrutiny.
Any missteps or procedural shortcuts in handling evidence could reflect poorly on his overall investigative process.
This line of questioning could further erode his reliability in the eyes of the jury or judge.
However, without a documented statement, this verbal presentation lacks the reviewability and accountability of a formal affidavit and is unlikely to meet standard legal requirements.
Without a written affidavit or documented justification, the probable cause assessment lacks a clear, reviewable basis.
You said:
Go over the entire document and compare his testimony to the ADA and teh testimony to Mr. Cruz.
This response emphasized his interpretation that Allen’s freedom was not restricted during their interaction.
Cruz questioned if other factors like being alone with an officer could constitute custody.
Evasiveness in Testimony Regarding Custody Timing
ADA Bartholomew’s Examination:
Bartholomew’s questioning did not explicitly address the timing of Allen’s custody, focusing instead on whether Miranda rights were issued and the procedural aspects of evidence collection.
There is no probable cause affidavit for arrest.
By adding interpretations or facts not supported by the witness testimony, he potentially misled the magistrate into issuing a search warrant based on distorted or unsupported claims.
This could lead to the suppression of any evidence obtained through the search.
By inserting a narrative that was not in witness statements, he may have demonstrated a predisposition toward a particular outcome in the investigation, compromising his neutrality.
Without this documentation, there is no verifiable record to support the legal grounds for detaining Allen.
Any deviation from these statements can be seen as either a misunderstanding or an intentional misrepresentation.
This omission denies a clear record of the arrest’s justification, raising due process concerns.
You said:
He was a close family member of one of the witnesses.
Non-disclosure of such a connection could severely impact the credibility of his investigation and might even lead to claims of bias, conflict of interest, or investigative misconduct.
Here’s an in-depth look at the implications of this undisclosed relationship and how it might affect the case:

1.
Failure to disclose a close relationship with a witness could suggest a lack of impartiality.
This lack of transparency could lead the court or jury to question his integrity and impartiality, which are crucial to his role as an investigator.
This could further erode his credibility, making his entire testimony appear suspect.
Courts may consider excluding evidence if it can be shown that the investigator’s personal connections influenced how the evidence was collected, documented, or presented.
They could question him on whether his personal connection affected his decision-making and why he didn’t inform the department of this relationship from the outset.
This undisclosed relationship raises questions about his objectivity and may suggest investigational bias.
You said:
He never reviewed the bar video until 4 years later at trial.
The video showed many deviations from witness statements and testimony.
She also testified to this at trial.
This is provably false by the video.
These discrepancies indicate potential failures in investigative diligence and reliability of key witness testimony, particularly regarding interactions between Lauren Deal and Mr. Allen.
Video evidence from Schooly’s bar would have been one of the most objective sources of information available to corroborate or challenge witness accounts, making it critical to the investigation’s accuracy and completeness.
The absence of video review at the time could suggest a lack of due process, as the decision to arrest and pursue charges appears to have been based solely on unverified statements.
Discrepancies in Witness Statements vs. Video Evidence
Contradictions in Lauren Deal’s Statements:
Initial Interaction with Mr. Allen: Lauren Deal claimed that she ran up and hugged Mr. Allen when she first saw him at the bar, and they sat around talking.
This false narrative, repeated both in her interview and in court testimony, undermines her credibility as it is provably false.
This false statement undermines Deal’s testimony about Allen’s intentions and character, misrepresenting his role that evening.
This contradiction indicates that her account of the night’s events was either mistaken or intentionally fabricated.
Inflated Narrative to Justify Probable Cause: The affidavit’s inaccuracies point to a potential embellishment to support probable cause where evidence was otherwise insufficient.
The defense could argue that these inaccuracies indicate investigative bias or even misconduct, seeking to exclude any evidence obtained under the false pretense of probable cause.
Consequences for Witness Credibility and Defense Leverage
Challenging Deal’s Credibility: The defense now has strong grounds to impeach Deal’s testimony based on objective evidence from the video, which contradicts her statements and trial testimony.
These inconsistencies could significantly weaken the prosecution’s case if the jury finds her untrustworthy or unreliable.
Deal’s provable falsehoods about her interactions with Allen and others directly impact the prosecution’s narrative, as her statements form the basis of the charges.
His willingness to proceed without verifying key evidence suggests a potentially biased investigation that may have favored Deal’s version of events without scrutiny.
Defense Leverage on Witness Credibility: The video evidence contradicting Deal’s statements and testimony provides strong grounds for the defense to impeach her credibility, potentially undermining the prosecution’s case if the jury doubts her reliability.
There were no identifying marks to say these pants were the accusers.
There was no proof as to how they got there.
Is it normal during an investigation not to have the pants verified as the accusers?
Why wouldn't the DA ask that they be verified?
Failure to confirm that the black pants belonged to the alleged victim, especially when the investigator himself admits there were "no identifying marks," represents a significant gap in investigative rigor.
In this situation, the black pants could be critical in corroborating the alleged victim's account of the events, especially given their presence at the suspect’s residence.
Identification of Evidence Ownership: Properly identifying and verifying that the pants belonged to the alleged victim would provide the prosecution with concrete support for their narrative, reinforcing that Deal was indeed at Allen’s residence and potentially strengthening her credibility.
Without verification that the pants belonged to Deal, their evidentiary value is questionable, as there is no proof that they were tied to her or the alleged events.
Failing to confirm that the pants belonged to the alleged victim could violate chain of custody principles, as the pants’ relevance is not established, and their connection to the victim remains speculative.
Without this confirmation, the pants lack the evidentiary foundation required for admissibility and reliability in court.
Without verification, the pants become circumstantial at best, potentially leading the jury to question why critical evidence was left unexamined.
Without verification, the DA risks relying on unsubstantiated claims about the pants, potentially introducing doubt about the thoroughness and integrity of the investigation.
Defense Leverage from Non-Verification
Challenge to Evidence Relevance: The defense can argue that the pants have no established connection to the case, as there is no proof they belonged to Deal or arrived at Allen’s residence under circumstances relevant to the allegations.
Questioning Investigative Diligence and Bias: The defense may claim that the lack of verification reflects a bias in the investigation, suggesting that the police and prosecution accepted Deal’s narrative without scrutinizing critical details, such as whether the pants were indeed hers.
○ Inadequate collection of evidence.
○ Lack of witness interviews.
Steve Happel reported that he was called on the phone by the prosecutor and the detective telling him that he knew the defendant was guilty.
Steve Happel testified to the facts of the case and not the narrative that was being presented by the prosecution.
For example, he testified that the keys were handed to DeMarco while Lauren Deal testified that she gave them to Ben Allen.
Standard investigative ethics require that officers disclose any pre-existing relationships with witnesses to avoid perceived or actual bias.
Implications of Non-Disclosure:
Non-disclosure of connections with witnesses can be grounds for questioning the objectivity of the investigation.
Altering statements without witness verification is a serious breach of investigative ethics and could amount to falsification, particularly if changes were made to fit a preconceived narrative.
These discrepancies provide grounds for the defense to challenge the validity of the probable cause affidavit, potentially leading to motions to suppress evidence obtained from the search.
These omissions suggest procedural neglect, as any uncollected evidence or unprotected scenes could introduce doubt about the accuracy of the investigation and the reliability of the findings presented in court.
Additionally, his failure to interview or collect statements from other potential witnesses reflects an incomplete investigation.
Additionally, Deal’s claim that Happel was the “drunkest that night” contradicts video evidence showing he drank the least, indicating a possible intent to discredit him.
Happel’s testimony contradicted Deal’s narrative in several respects, including who held Deal’s keys (DeMarco, not Allen) and other events that night.
Implications for Investigation and Trial:
Comments that reveal bias against a witness undermine the perceived impartiality of the investigation, especially if they target a witness providing testimony that doesn’t align with the prosecution.
These lapses suggest investigative bias and a lack of adherence to standard investigative protocols.
These gaps could provide strong grounds for the defense to argue that the investigation was biased and incomplete.
Conflicting Accounts and Delayed Hospital Transfer
Inconsistencies in Testimony:
Lauren Deal and her mother’s account of leaving CCH immediately for another hospital conflicts with testimony indicating they waited for someone to bring them personal items from nearly an hour away.
This conflicting narrative undermines the credibility of Deal’s and her mother’s testimony, as it raises questions about what actually transpired during their time at CCH.
If law enforcement did indeed arrive at CCH, this would contradict the narrative presented by Deal and her mother, indicating that additional undisclosed events or agreements may have influenced the case’s initial handling.
Potential Legal Violations and Obstruction of Justice
Withholding 911 Records and Reports:
The refusal to provide 911 records or incident reports for that night is concerning.
This lack of transparency raises suspicion and could suggest that evidence of the hospital’s and law enforcement’s initial response is being deliberately concealed.
Conflicting Narratives and Credibility Issues: Discrepancies in the timeline, such as Deal and her mother’s claim of leaving CCH immediately versus waiting for personal items to be delivered, cast doubt on the credibility of their account and suggest that undisclosed events may have influenced the initial response.

Prosecutorial Violations
OFFERING A PLEA DEAL UNDER FALSE PRETENSES
Claim:
ADA Bartholomew admitted in the judges chambers that she misunderstood the DNA evidence when offering a plea deal.
Evidence:
The defendant claims that the ADA offered a plea bargain based on a flawed DNA evidence interpretation.
When the plea was declined, she returned to the Grand Jury to add an aggravating factor to the indictment​.
Evidence:
Discovery was not turned over until the last minute, including during trial​​.
Defense had to file multiple continuances because of insufficient discovery and medical record delays​.
Assertion: Defense requested continuances citing lack of disclosure.
Prejudice: Impaired defense (e.g., DNA expert unable to evaluate evidence fully).
SUPPRESSION OR LATE DISCLOSURE OF EVIDENCE (BRADY VIOLATION)
Claim:
ADA Bartholomew suppressed or disclosed critical evidence inadequately or too late for effective defense use.
Evidence:
DNA and mental health record delays.
The failure to do so constitutes a Brady violation, regardless of intent.
Conclusion:
A viable Brady claim arises from the ADA’s misconduct in evidence management.
SUBORNING PERJURY / KNOWING PRESENTATION OF FALSE TESTIMONY
Claim:
The ADA knowingly relied on Lauren Deal's impeachable testimony, despite prior notice of its unreliability.
Evidence:
Witness inconsistencies are well-documented.
Despite this, the ADA proceeded with the retrial and presented the witness again.
Application:
The ADA had credible knowledge that Lauren Deal committed perjury, as demonstrated by internal contradictions and evidence held by the DA.
In that case, proceeding with her testimony without correction constitutes suborning perjury.
Evidence:
ADA retried the case post-mistrial (12-0, 9-3 for innocence)​.
Reindicted with aggravating factor after plea rejection.
Ignored the defense’s presentation of impeaching evidence.
Application:
The ADA’s actions violated both rules, particularly failing to disclose, misrepresenting the context of the plea, and ignoring impeachment.
Cross-Examination Deficiencies:  The defense attorneys' alleged failure to cross-examine key witnesses effectively, particularly regarding inconsistencies and potential biases, represents a significant dereliction of duty.
Furthermore, the failure to adequately investigate extortion claims, which could have provided exculpatory evidence or revealed alternative motives, demonstrates a lack of diligence and advocacy.
False Plea Deal | Bordenkircher, Blackledge | ✔️
Speedy Trial Violation | Barker, Pippin, N.C. Const.
The lack of effort and evidence collection is believed to have been undertaken intentionally for nefarious reasons.
Premature Charging: The suspect was charged within three hours, an unreasonably short timeframe that showed a rush to judgment or corruption before proper evidence collection and analysis.
Key Witness Omission: Critical witnesses, such as Peter West and James Morrison, were not interviewed, representing a significant failure to gather all pertinent information.
The detective claimed 
Incomplete Evidence Documentation: The documentation of evidence was incomplete, raising concerns about the transparency and accountability of the investigative process.
Investigative Failure
Detective Freeman admitted in court he never interviewed James Morrison.
They had connections with law enforcement and local government that were not disclosed.
They were deliberately avoided as witnesses, which appears to be part of a pattern of selective investigation.
He claimed they were not present at the time of the incident, yet video evidence clearly shows that they were at the bar with Lauren Deal before the alleged incident took place.
They might have offered crucial information that could have added valuable details to the case.
Carmen Love Inconsistencies: Witness Credibility Issues
Evolving Truth: Carmen Love's interviews presented stark inconsistencies.
Her initial interview omitted any mention of assault, focusing solely on social interactions.
Carmen said that she had never heard the defendant’s name.
Sudden Assault Account: A subsequent interview dramatically shifted, introducing detailed accounts of an assault, raising red flags about the veracity and reliability of her statements.
Evidence Fabrication: Statements within the interviews display the willingness to fabricate evidence, further undermining the witness's credibility and the investigation.
Misrepresentation of DNA Evidence: The ADA misrepresented DNA evidence, misleading the court and the jury.
Selective Witness Interviewing: Witness interviews were conducted selectively to create a biased narrative, neglecting potentially exculpatory information.
Accuser Statement Reliability Issues: Concerns exist regarding the reliability of accusers' statements used as primary evidence.
Evidence Verification Failures: Lack of Scrutiny
Unverified Accuser Claims: The detective failed to adequately verify the accuser's claims regarding movements after the alleged incident.
Physical Layout Contradiction: Physical evidence and the crime scene layout contradicted the accuser's account, yet these discrepancies were not thoroughly investigated.
Failure to Cross-Examine: Defense attorneys failed to cross-examine key witnesses, missing critical opportunities to challenge testimony.
The defense did not question why witnesses such as Carmen Love were not present at the trial.
Extortion Claims Ignored: Defense counsel did not adequately investigate extortion claims, overlooking potentially exculpatory avenues.
Improper Forensic Evidence: Improper or extremely weak forensic evidence was presented, failing to meet evidentiary standards.
Eyewitness Identification Errors: Potential errors in eyewitness identification were not adequately addressed, contributing to the flawed process.
Brady Violations
Failure to Correct Known False Testimony
The ADA repeatedly refused to correct testimony known to be false, explicitly violating the prosecutors' constitutional obligation to rectify perjured testimony.
Persistent refusal to rectify perjured testimony directly contravenes this standard.
There was no apparent reason for the detective to read this statement as Hoskins was present to testify.
The Detective reading the statement didn’t allow cross-examination and should not have been allowed.
Removal of confusing passages and inconsistencies from the original statement.
Omission of personal feelings and emotional reactions of the witness.
Removal of mentions of other potentially involved individuals.
Additionally, essential crime scene evidence—such as bedding and bathroom trash—was not collected, and no photographs were taken, violating NCGS §15A-268.
Pants allegedly belonging to the accuser were never adequately tested, further undermining probable cause.
Evidentiary Deficiencies: Critical investigative steps were omitted:
Failure to secure physical evidence.
Lack of evaluation of the alleged crime scene.
Inadequate assessment of witness credibility.
Failure to investigate inconsistencies in the accuser's statements.
Misrepresentation of DNA Evidence in Plea Negotiations
False Pretenses for Plea Deal: Coercive Tactics
False DNA Claim: The ADA falsely misrepresented the existence of the defendant's DNA as evidence to coerce the defendant into accepting a plea deal.
Inadequate storage of evidence.
Insufficient documentation of evidence with crime scene information.
Lack of restrictions on who handled the evidence.
Memory loss among witnesses due to extended delays, undermining the reliability of testimony.
Selective focus on evidence that supported the accuser's allegations.
Hospital Video Timestamp Manipulation
Timeline Evidence Alteration: Potential Cover-Up
Timestamp Misrepresentation: Detective Freeman appears to have deliberately misrepresented the timestamp of a hospital video, claiming it was recorded at 3:42 AM when metadata indicated a creation time of 2:42 AM.
Critical Timeline Discrepancy: This one-hour discrepancy is crucial to the timeline of events and raises concerns about:
Potential manipulation of evidence to fit a predetermined narrative.
Fabricated Assault and False Allegations
Conspiracy to Create False Narrative: Deceptive Scheme
Assault Fabrication: Evidence suggests the alleged sexual assault was fabricated and part of a coordinated deceptive scheme involving multiple individuals.
Conspiracy Elements: This conspiracy included:
The evolution of the story over time indicates a constructed narrative.
Inconsistent and changing narratives between interviews, highlighting fabrication.
Financial Motivation for False Accusations
Attempted Bribery Evidence: Financial Gain Incentive
Bribery Attempt: Evidence emerged of a mutual friend offering a substantial bribe ($15,000 per year for 10 years) to make the case "go away," suggesting financial motivation behind the allegations.
Accuser's Financial Circumstances: The accuser's circumstances as a single mother recently evicted from her boyfriend's residence provided a plausible financial motive for fabricating the assault claim to secure financial benefits.
False Evidence Claims: The ADA falsely claimed:
Lab results identified the defendant's DNA/sperm, which was untrue.
Evidence of damage to the victim’s vagina was evident, also untrue.
Deliberate Misrepresentation: These false claims constitute deliberate misrepresentation, likely used to secure the indictment from the Grand Jury based on fabricated information.
Time Gap in the Investigation Timeline
Unexplained Critical Timeline Void: Investigative Neglect
Uninvestigated Time Gap: The detective or attorneys never investigated a significant, unexplained one-hour gap in the timeline of events, representing a critical oversight.
Potential Lost Evidence: This time gap could potentially contain crucial, unexamined information that is highly relevant to the case.
The evidence points to this being a fabrication that should have been investigated by the defense and the district attorney’s office.
Inconsistent Hospital Timeline
Deliberate Timeline Manipulation: Deception Indicated
Hospital Timeline Discrepancies: Major discrepancies exist regarding Lauren's arrival times at Central Carolina Hospital (CCH) and UNC Hospital, suggesting deliberate timeline manipulation.
Unexplained Two-Hour Gap: An unexplained two-hour period remains unaccounted for, raising suspicions of deliberate deception or concealment of critical events during this period.
Security camera timestamps, video footage, and official documents contradict witness accounts of the timeline.
Contradictory Video Evidence Ignored
Exculpatory Surveillance Footage: Evidence Disregarded
Video Evidence Contradiction: Video evidence from Schooly's bar directly contradicted witness statements, yet law enforcement or prosecution did not properly investigate or acknowledge this crucial contradiction.
The contradictory statements and other exaggerations were put into an affidavit to provide the illusion of guilt.
Exculpatory Potential: This video evidence had the potential to significantly challenge the credibility of multiple witnesses and potentially exonerate the defendant, yet was ignored.
Misrepresentation of Evidence in the Opening Statement
Misleading Jury with False Information: Ethical Breach
Opening Statement Misrepresentation: The ADA misrepresented DNA evidence to the jury during her opening statement.
Rehearsed Witness Testimony
Coordinated Witness Preparation: Authenticity Compromised
Rehearsed Testimonies: Evidence suggests that Lauren and her mother's testimonies appeared rehearsed, indicating potential witness coaching and manipulation of their accounts.
Witness Coaching: Witness Steve Happel's account details, observing Lauren receiving explicit coaching for her testimony, raising severe concerns about the authenticity and reliability of their statements.
Missing and Lost Phone Evidence
Critical Evidence Not Preserved: Evidence Handling Failure
Lost Phone and Data: The legal team was entrusted with a phone and an expert’s fee of  $5,000 to extract data from a telephone containing potentially exculpatory text messages, but the phone and the extracted data have been irretrievably lost.
Second Interview Contradictions from Carmen Love
Dramatically Changed Story Between Interviews: Witness Deception
First Interview Denial: In her first interview with Detective Freeman, Carmen Love explicitly denied knowing Ben Allen when directly asked.
Second Interview Reversal: In a subsequent interview with a private investigator, Carmen Love completely contradicted her initial statements, claiming extensive interaction and conversation with Ben Allen at the bar.
This complete reversal in testimony indicates deliberate deception and potential witness tampering or coordination.
Carmen Love's Undisclosed Survivor Status Impact
Biased Witness with Undisclosed Motivations: Impartiality Questioned
Undisclosed Bias: In her second interview, Carmen Love revealed she is a survivor of domestic violence and rape, a critical detail not disclosed in her first interview with law enforcement.
Unexplored Bias: This undisclosed background created a significant and unexamined bias that was never explored or considered during the official investigation, potentially influencing her testimony and perceptions.
Yet, this video was not documented in initial reports or used as evidence for issuing an arrest warrant.
Chain of Custody Neglect: Despite lacking any documented chain of custody, this video evidence was later introduced during court proceedings, raising serious questions about its authenticity and admissibility.
Inconsistent Records Timing: The timing of hospital records appears inconsistent with the physical timeline of events, suggesting potential manipulation or improper maintenance of official medical records.
Missing 911 Records
Critical Emergency Records Not Provided: Transparency Issues
Non-Disclosure of 911 Records: The failure to release 911 records and other relevant documentation from the alleged incident creates valid grounds for questioning the integrity and validity of the initial investigation.
Systematic Failures: Basic investigative steps that should have been routinely taken based on his training and experience were repeatedly and demonstrably ignored throughout this investigation, indicating gross incompetence or deliberate misconduct.
Initial interviews with Deal and Love reveal inconsistencies (e.g., Love denies knowing Allen, and no mention of any invitation by the defendant).
DNA swab consented by Allen; no incriminating results.
Extortion allegations surface (~$150,000 demanded).
Video evidence contradicts statements but is restricted in presentation.
He also gave inconsistent testimony on the arrest process.10
Failure to Establish Probable Cause: No affidavit or notes documented probable cause; reliance on uncorroborated, contradictory statements (e.g., Deal's account biomechanically implausible; Love's initial contradictions).
Elements like Allen's presence, Deal's screaming, and denial fall short of "fair probability" of guilt.11
Key Witness Identities and Connections
Peter West: Present with Lauren Deal at bars; father employed by the Sheriff's Department; local government inspector; connections to the Sheriff and magistrate.12
James Morrison: Carmen Love's boyfriend; city government employee since 2010; similar justice system connections; close ties to Detective Freeman.13
Familial Relationship and Witness Omissions: Detective Freeman, related to witness Carmen Love, did not interview Peter West or James Morrison despite their presence and potential relevance.
His testimony denied knowledge of them, contradicting available evidence (e.g., photos, local common knowledge).
This omission could have deprived the defense of information regarding the accuser's intoxication and behavior, thereby violating Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963).
This dereliction suggests bad faith under Arizona v. Youngblood, 488 U.S. 51 (1988).16
Prosecutorial Misconduct
The ADA's conduct raises concerns about fairness, including potential misrepresentations and delays.17
Misrepresentation of DNA Evidence: The ADA allegedly misrepresented DNA evidence in plea talks and added an aggravating factor post-refusal, potentially constituting coercive tactics under the Fourteenth Amendment.
Witness statements (e.g., Carmen Love's) evolved, raising credibility questions (e.g., from denial to detailed familiarity).18
Selective Witness Interviewing and Procedural Abuse: Excessive 37 continuances over four years caused undue hardship (e.g., lost phone data, witness memory fade, economic impact on Allen).
Contradictions in Deal's account (e.g., impossible escape, no woods/run, 75% illumination vs. "pitch black") not examined.24
Accuser Statement Reliability: Initial focus on "feet hurt," not assault; no "rape" mentioned.
Contradicted by video (e.g., no pre-departure interaction with Allen).25
Chain of Custody Problems: Documents replaced at trial; edited witness statements (e.g., Hoskins') violated hearsay rules and Confrontation Clause under Crawford v. Washington, 541 U.S. 36 (2004).26
Unverified Claims: Deal's outrunning fit soldiers implausible; physical layout contradictions ignored.27
Defense Representation Issues
The defendant suffered from ineffective assistance, undermining fair defense under Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984).28
Failure to Cross-Examine: No questioning on Love's absence or inconsistencies.
Extortion Claims Ignored: Private detective ordered not to pursue $150,000 demand.
Loss of Data: Phone records with exculpatory info lost; initial interviews vanished.
These failures prejudiced the outcome, as post-trial juror feedback indicated that knowledge of the extortion attempt would have led to immediate acquittal.
Disclosure must occur timely manner; here, it did not.29
Types: Negating guilt (e.g., video contradictions); impeachment (e.g., conflicts); discrediting police (e.g., Freeman's perjury).
Economic and Emotional Harm
Significant Prejudice: Loss of income, job termination, emotional distress to family; witness memory loss.
No conviction occurred, and retrial may be unwarranted given weaknesses.

I was not convicted.
BARD - I was not convicted.
BARD - I was not convicted.
There was no hope that this case would be dismissed once I refused to be bribed.
The bribe was never presented to the court, but I turned over the text messages to my attorneys as soon as it happened.
My attorneys didn’t dispute the prosecutorial misconduct when I was offered a plea deal using false information.
We were told that my sperm and DNA were found and that I was done, so I should just accept the plea.
Instead of confronting the ADA, he requested that the court pay for a DNA expert.
The ADA later admitted she made a mistake.
This only came out because I refused to return to the courtroom.
No one was looking out for my interest, and my attorneys let the ADA abuse her authority.
It was the only way I knew to force my attorneys to handle the situation.
The ADA said it was an honest mistake, and the judge said it didn’t prejudice my case since the court paid for a DNA expert.
A DNA expert who didn’t even get to testify due to the ADA pushing her time, ensuring he would already be gone.
If she offered me that plea as an honest mistake, was the same misrepresentation of the evidence provided to the grand jury?
She missed deadlines without concern and failed to follow through on document production, forcing additional delays.
I could not present a reasonable defense because evidence was lost during these forced delays.
This was never brought up during my trial.
The prosecution was allowed to present the evidence as if I was trying to hide it.
The attorney to whom I reported the item no longer represented me, so he could not handle this miscommunication in person or give a statement that no search warrant was required since he was to address it with the DA.
Even though he was with the same firm then, this wasn’t represented to the court during my trial.
The vast discrepancies between the conversations of the witnesses and the detective and the same witnesses and the private investigator were never brought up to the court.
Significant differences made it apparent that the statements made to the police and the private investigator were false.
The discrepancies in the accuser's statements on the stand were not addressed.
Once she testified, it should have been relatively easy to point out how ridiculous this route was if one was running for their life.
This could be combined with how she claimed the event occurred.
I asked my attorneys when we could press perjury charges since the statements about the event were not physiologically possible.
They also never asked about the hour gap in the timeline that was in the witness testimony.
The fact that the other gentlemen with Lauren Deal that night were not interviewed also leads one to suspect the investigation.
There was no concern to detail the night's events to ascertain a solid timeline.
The detective in charge of the investigation had many hours of investigative training.
He didn’t attempt to utilize any of that training to establish an investigation.
He also didn’t report that on the night he arrested me (after a four-hour investigation) he said he would work with the magistrate to get my bail lowered so I could go home.
I believe it was because he knew I didn’t do it but was told to carry out the arrest, which brings me to Brady violations.
It was said that more conversations occurred about this case with the detective.
They were not turned over in discovery.
One of the state's witnesses even testified in court to intimidation by the detective and the ADA
while he was there to testify and over the phone during an interview.
This unjust prosecution was marked by many changes of the presiding judge, not allowing the Honorable Winston Gilchrist to have visibility of the repeated abuse of position by the ADA.
This didn’t allow my attorneys ample time for review to add to my defense.
The DNA specialist didn't get to testify due to a surgery he had scheduled.
As he departed, he told my mother that he had told the ADA in plenty of time, and she had told him he would be able to testify Thursday.
The ADA presented 95 pieces of evidence to the jury, the defense didn’t present a single piece of evidence, and yet the vote was 12-0 on the
charge of 1st-degree rape.
When we returned to court on 31 October 2023, my attorney asked the ADA why she was pursuing another trial.
My attorney tried to tell her the actual count but eventually gave up as he said it was useless because she wouldn't listen.
This is just another example of how the truth doesn’t matter to anyone involved in this case.
The person who tried to bribe me is friends with all the parties involved, including
the accuser's family and the police force.
I was proven innocent in the first case.
A 12-0 and 9-3 verdict in my favor without us even presenting evidence.
BARD - I was not convicted.
It is my belief That This young attorney Was acting Within the scope that was assigned to him By the founder of The Firm.
This limitation Didn't allow him to understand.
The other issue Was the States Witnesses Showing up to the case Their inability To have a deposition For Miss Tiffany Allen Severely damage the case It is.
The fact that they didn't Give a deposition Or deposition time for Miss Allen.
Also, limited to testimony Of Roger Hoskins.
And yet there's also one more which is probably the most important reason in which all these Witnesses being present, Would have been essential, Is to show the Corruption And bias.
The statement alone from the first officer that interviewed Lauren deal The statement that set his job was to ensure That my defendant was found guilty.
They limited amount of documentation that this officer maintained Was abysmal, The lack of any sort of timeline.
Uh, any lack of corroboration between Witnesses and their statements Later interviews to verify previous statements.
If he had taken The betting For more this had occurred, He could prove or disprove One of those involved statements.
If he had taken them and any DNA From the accuser has shown up any hair sample, Anything had Has shown up that she had been in that bed.
It would have directly contradicted.
This is why we believe he didn't take them.
He knew that the accuser Was making up this story.
And if he was a take Those materials as evidence, He himself Would be proving That she was lying.
This was going acceptable since He had a family member involved in this investigation.
We can tell that there was a blatant attempt And ensuring one outcome And that outcome Was not Innocence.
Was documented In the extreme Mystery Allen and Miss Allen's previous custody case.
It is our belief That detective frame and should have taken the time to at least review some of the notes from that case or as permission.
And if she had given a partial bit of that documentation, he could have also asked for our mental assessments to be included Or any of the assessments, by the multitude Of psychological representatives.
Every individual in the Allen case, Had a therapist And all of these therapists For managed By an expert That everyone with the court.
Put on Where the taxpayer again, Had to pay for the bad decisions Of those Willing To lie For their own gain.
Mr. Allen's attorney unwillingness.
This was apparently not the case.
Mr. Allen found out During his trial Attorney.
Once Pretty much stated That he had summarily ignored The extortion, attempt From the opposing party, If nothing else.
So he may never practice law again Because he surely did not practice law In this case.
There are still many unknowns While everyone else in this case.
We don't understand why Jolanda made this statement that it didn't matter if Miss Rowland was guilty or not.
This is a pretty important statement Because it aligns itself perfectly With what the officer said In the first interview With Missile.
Corroboration Of guilt Between those And the Lee County Sheriff's Department.
We think it important the court to know, Mr. Allen's Previous interactions And how He knows that there is a Joe Linda but doesn't know Or did not know her last name.
He simply stated that his children were not allowed To be in the vehicle.
Jolanda Was driving, The statement wasn't made for any personal reason, But for the safety of his children, 

To all those involved.
In this case, Mr. Alam was only aware of her involvement.
If I said I was innocent Her friends at the police department, Would make sure that that didn't matter.
But combined with the other factors and the fact patterns that are established in this case, 

The preponderance of evidence Leeds.
One to believe That not only was a statement true But her friends ended up the police department Toad of the truth.
They acted in every manner possible To ensure That there was no impartiality or fairness In this case.
These weren't allowed For Mr. Allen He had made the wrong people, Angry Far before The accusation.
Justice isn't Wade By the scales of the blonde folded lady.
I also fundamentally believe That if the roles will reversed And he was the founding partner of the firm, The outcome of this case Would have been vastly different.

Her inflammatory statements are the only ones available online and were raised during the trial but ultimately disregarded."
Witness Testimony and Evidence Handling: The transcript excerpt (Section 5) details a witness's account of an incident involving a victim (Lauren), including her condition, interactions at hospitals, and subsequent actions like reporting to the police.
This ties into broader themes of evidence collection, witness credibility, and the role of supporting individuals (e.g., Joseph's friend and Mr. DeMarco).
Deceased Witnesses and Disregarded Statements: Section 2 addresses Ms. Allen's death and the handling of her "inflammatory statements," which were raised but ultimately dismissed in the trial.
Evidence Admissibility and Hearsay (Section 2): Ms. Allen's "inflammatory statements" were disregarded, which could involve risks related to hearsay rules (e.g., under Federal Rules of Evidence 801–803).
Arguments might focus on the witness's reliability, as there's a noted "no response recorded" to one question, potentially indicating gaps in evidence.
Additionally, references to third parties (e.g., Mr. DeMarco's behavior) could lead to arguments about motive, bias, or relevance, with risks of defamation claims if details are misrepresented.
It avoids emotional language, inflammatory rhetoric, or bias, focusing instead on factual reporting and clarity.
Professionalism: There are no signs of aggression, sarcasm, or defensiveness.
Factual discrepancies, like conflicting timelines from Tiffany, Roger, and Freeman, pose arguments about witness perjury or unreliable testimony, which could be used in cross-examinations to suppress evidence or question alibis.
This approach avoids bias or emotional language, using objective phrasing (e.g., "verify the timelines") to present facts without advocating for any party.
I was in shock at the accusations.
I know she has accused numerous people over the years but I never thought she would accuse me.
Tiffany said that I wasn’t “participating” in the investigation.
The magistrate wouldn’t even look at the documents that I had.
I wanted a bench trial because I was concerned about Tiffany taking out another affidavit with more false information and getting me arrested again.
My lawyer said that it would attach jeopardy to her claim so she couldn’t file it again.
They still didn’t give me a bench trial.
Mr. Whitaker informed them that if she did it again then we would file our own charges.
She informed me that there had been new allegations coming from the children.
There is also a required polygraph.
They should have told me immediately about the accusations she was making.
The allegations she made should have been relayed to me so that I could have restricted her access to the kids until she either recovered or managed contact under supervision, as was the court's direction during our custody case.
If law enforcement had done the slightest amount of investigation, they would have discovered the compromising situation my children were placed in and should have notified me of her accusations so that previous court requirements could have been reinstated for the protection of my children.

However, her familial connection to Detective Freeman raises concerns about her objectivity.
This also creates the question of why Freeman believed this person making statements that could not be true.
Investigative Shortcomings


Lack of Evidence Collection: Detective Steve Freeman's failure to collect physical evidence from the alleged crime scene is a significant oversight.
Legal and Ethical Considerations


Brady and Giglio Violations : The prosecution's failure to disclose evidence that could impeach the credibility of witnesses, particularly Detective Freeman, may constitute violations of Brady and Giglio.
Specific instances in this case include:
Failure to disclose the familial relationship between Detective Freeman and Carmen Love, a key witness.
Detective Freeman's potentially false testimony about the timeline of events, particularly regarding the hospital video timestamp.
c) Malicious Prosecution: The actions of Detective Freeman and the ADA may constitute malicious prosecution.
Misrepresentation of Evidence:
a) Manipulation of Video Evidence: Detective Freeman appears to have misrepresented the timestamp of the hospital video, claiming it was recorded at 3:42 AM when metadata shows it was created at 2:42 AM.
Bad Investigative Techniques:
a) Failure to Conduct Thorough Interviews: Detective Freeman failed to interview key witnesses, including Peter West and James Morrison, who were present at Schooly's.
d) Biased Approach to Investigation: Detective Freeman's approach shows signs of confirmation bias, where he appears to have focused on evidence that supported the accuser's claims while ignoring or failing to pursue evidence that might exonerate Mr. Allen.
§ 242 - Deprivation of Rights Under Color of Law:
The actions of Detective Freeman and potentially the ADA may violate this federal statute, which makes it a crime for a person acting under color of any law to willfully deprive a person of a right or privilege protected by the Constitution or laws of the United States.
Rushed Investigation:
Detective Freeman's decision to arrest Mr. Allen after only a few hours of investigation, without thoroughly examining all available evidence or interviewing all potential witnesses, suggests a rush to judgment that is incompatible with a proper probable cause determination.
Potential Bias:
The familial relationship between Detective Freeman and Carmen Love introduces a potential bias that should have disqualified Freeman from making the probable cause determination.
Failure to Consider Alternative Explanations:
There's no evidence that Detective Freeman seriously considered alternative explanations for Lauren Deal's allegations, such as consensual activity or false accusation.
To assess probable cause for arrest, I'll need to carefully analyze the interview content, apply relevant legal principles, and consider the totality of the circumstances known to Detective Freeman at the time.
The key question is what additional information Detective Freeman had beyond this interview to establish probable cause.
Potential Issues:
Lack of specifics about events at Allen's house
No mention of sexual contact or assault
Allen's voluntary cooperation
Absence of physical evidence mentioned
To justify the arrest, Detective Freeman would need additional evidence not presented in this interview, such as:
Lauren's statement alleging assault
Physical evidence supporting the allegation
Witness corroboration of key events
Inconsistencies in Allen's account compared to other evidence
Conclusion:
Based solely on this interview, there does not appear to be probable cause for arrest on sexual assault charges.
However, the final determination would depend on other evidence available to Detective Freeman at the time of arrest.
Given this analysis, Detective Freeman should have given Miranda warnings at the point when:
The questioning became focused on potential criminal activity
A reasonable person in Allen's position would no longer feel free to leave
This likely occurred when Freeman began asking specific questions about the events with Lauren, rather than just general background information.
In conclusion, while the initial part of the conversation may not have required Miranda warnings, Detective Freeman should have provided them once the questioning focused on the specific events of the night in question and Allen's potential involvement in criminal activity.
Fact Note: Carmen Love does change her story later, but if she had changed it within the 3-hour window of this investigation prior to arrest, 
a) it would have been recorded as Freeman was recording every call from that day, 
b) it would have raised red flags because of how dramatic her later story became.
and then I saw them go inside cuz she needed to use the bathroom.”

Fact Note: Freeman created a false narrative that favored the prosecution.
Freeman’s Affidavit:
"Mr. DeMarco made the decision to get his vehicle and ride in an attempt to locate her and did so on the roadway, which was later identified as Old US 1."
Freeman Police Interview:
DeMarco’s actual statement:
"I was like...
Freeman affidavit: "Once in the bathroom, Ben refused to leave and he stated he wasn't."
Freeman Affidavit: 
"After being treated she was taken to UNC Hospitals in Chapel Hill for further treatment and conducted a sexual assault kit and exam."
Fact Note: Freeman’s account makes clear that she was treated at CCH.
Freeman concealed the fact that officers had met with them at CCH, prioritizing his attendance at his brother’s wedding over his duty to disclose material facts.
Freeman Affidavit 
Phone Interview, " I was like..
Freeman is changing the witness testimony as he sees fit.
This is what Steve Happel told Detective Freeman during his phone conversation, 
“ Yeah ,we just we we showed up at Schoolys.
Another fabrication by Freeman.
Freeman affidavit: "After the interview was concluded Mr. Allen exited the interview room and was taken into custody and charged with First degree forcible rape."
Freeman knew that the defendant wasn’t a criminal and would comply with his requests.
Freeman took full advantage of that, even leaving him with his cell phone and offering to talk to the magistrate to get his bail lowered.
This set of circumstances, backed by proof, contradicts Freeman's testimony.
Freeman’s Affidavit Claim:  "Mr. Demarco stated that shortly thereafter Lauren went inside to use the bathroom and Ben followed."
Freeman’s Affidavit Claim: 
"Mr. Demarco made the decision to get his vehicle and ride in an attempt to locate her and did on the roadway, which was later identified as Old US 1."
If Freeman had been investigating, he would have noticed the difference in claims.
FREEMAN: "What's his name again?
Freeman knew the people she was discussing but pretended not to.
Deal's Injuries: Haines stated Deal claimed bruises on her arms, but Freeman stated he noticed them only after the interview.
STEVE FREEMAN CROSS EXAM BY MR. CRUZ
A: Yeah.
Captain Freeman, if you will return to the stand.
The jury entered the courtroom and were seated in jury box
Q: Captain Freeman, before we get to State's Exhibit that's on the screen, I want to go back real quick.

1) Carmen Love lied about knowing Joseph Deal
2) Tiffany Adcock lied when she told Freeman that I wanted her to call and ask Jolinda for help
3) The evidence clearly shows that neither of them knew him.
Freeman made four phone calls and arrested me in four hours.
While the video got me started writing this email, the call with Carmen Love got me wondering about Freeman.

INVESTIGATOR Ethical Concerns of THE Allen Case
The investigator’s conduct, Detective Steve Freeman of the Lee County Sheriff’s Office,  introduces complex legal and ethical issues that could significantly impact the case.
Here’s a detailed analysis of the various aspects:
Conflict of Interest with the Investigator:
Legal Aspect: Detective Freeman, a witness's family member, introduces a conflict of interest.
The familial relationship between Detective Freeman and Carmen Love already undermines the case's credibility.
The report necessitates a comprehensive inquiry into the actions of Detective Steve Freeman, the Assistant District Attorney (ADA) Tiffany Bartholomew, and each entity that comprises the Lee County judicial framework.
Investigative Failures and Detective Misconduct
As detailed, Detective Freeman's investigation is not simply inadequate; it appears to be fundamentally compromised by bias and a deliberate disregard for established protocol.
Detective Bias: The undisclosed familial relationship between Detective Freeman and Carmen Love, a key witness, immediately triggers a profound ethical alarm.
Freeman's failure to disclose this relationship, coupled with his reliance on Love's evolving and demonstrably inconsistent statements, exposes a calculated manipulation of the investigative process.
Freeman's tenuous excuse – claiming they were not present at the 'incident' despite video evidence placing them with the accuser earlier – is transparently disingenuous.
Detective Freeman's testimony reveals a shocking dereliction of duty.
To ensure a pre-determined outcome, Freeman's extensive training and experience render his procedural lapses not as incompetence but as a calculated disregard for proper procedure.
False Statements: Detective Freeman's affidavit is riddled with demonstrable falsehoods regarding the timeline, witness statements, and events surrounding the alleged incident.
Freeman’s conflicting priorities, such as attending his brother’s wedding, influenced this decision, as he preferred not to engage in a formal investigation that evening.
For instance, Freeman’s connection to the case, such as his family members allowing him to attend his brother’s wedding, motivated a delay in reporting and investigation.
Coercive Tactics: 
Selective Witness Interviewing:The report reveals a pattern of selective witness interviews conducted by the ADA, mirroring Detective Freeman's approach and exacerbated by substantial discovery violations.
Failure to Investigate Extortion Claims:
Attorney Conflict of Interest: The alleged conflict of interest arising from the defense attorney's previous relationship with Detective Freeman is deeply concerning.
Network of Improper Relationships: The connection between Detective Freeman and the defendant's attorney and their history of collaborative casework, coupled with the familial and social ties within local law enforcement and government, raises serious concerns about a potential network of improper relationships influencing the administration of justice.
This case demands a thorough and independent investigation into the allegations of misconduct against Detective Freeman and the ADA and the broader systemic issues within the Lee County Sheriff’s Department and the judicial framework.
Freeman’s Background and Experience
Freeman’s experience spans nearly three decades in law enforcement.
Freeman is a Captain with the Lee County Sheriff's Office, responsible for Professional Standards and Internal Investigations, which includes oversight of hiring and internal investigations​.
Initial Steps and Involvement in the Case
Freeman was initially contacted while attending his brother’s wedding regarding a sexual assault report filed by Lauren Deal.
On October 19, 2019, Freeman was informed of the alleged sexual assault while at his brother’s wedding.
This sequence of events clearly indicates that Freeman took charge of the investigation and was likely the key decision-maker in subsequent procedural matters, such as evidence collection, interviews, and determining the next steps.
Freeman’s Interaction with Key Individuals
Freeman’s interactions with Deal and Allen, as well as other individuals involved, are as follows:
Interview with Lauren Deal:
Freeman interviewed Deal that same day in a room equipped with audio and video recording capabilities.
Freeman interviewed him in a separate room from where he had interviewed Deal earlier.
This interview room was equipped with audio and video recording capabilities, and Freeman started recording by pressing a button outside the door.
During the interview, Freeman asked Allen about his interactions with Deal on the night of October 18.
Freeman asked Allen to sign a consent form for a buccal swab (DNA sample), which Allen agreed to and signed.
Freeman then collected the buccal swab and documented it as evidence.
Interviews with Other Individuals:
Freeman contacted Joe DeMarco to obtain details of the case and further contact information for Steve Happel.
The phone interviews with Freeman on October 19 were recorded, although he noted they were reluctant to participate fully​.
Freeman also interviewed Tiffany Allen and Roger Hoskins on October 31, with Hoskins later providing a written and signed statement.
Freeman recorded Hoskins’ statement, obtained his signature, and also typed a formal version of Hoskins' statement for clarity and verification.
Both Hoskins and Freeman signed this typed statement, which Freeman then documented as evidence​.
Freeman additionally reviewed text messages and digital evidence from Deal and friends Tiffany Allen and Carmen Love, which were pertinent to the timeline and context of the reported events​.
These interactions built Freeman’s case and informed his conclusions regarding probable cause, but they also revealed omissions in documentation and custody procedures, particularly concerning the arrest of Benjamin Allen, without any cross-referencing of details received.
Collection and Documentation of Evidence
Evidence collected and managed by Freeman includes:
Physical Evidence: Freeman and Lieutenant Smith later visited Allen's residence at 94 Beacon Circle to check for any items she left behind.
Freeman did not seize the items immediately, as he would have needed either a search warrant or the resident’s consent.
Freeman retrieved Deal’s medical records and her Sexual Assault Evidence Collection Kit (SAECK) from UNC Hospital Police.
DNA Sample: Freeman obtained Allen’s consent for a buccal swab, which he documented as evidence.
Video Surveillance: Freeman reviewed hours of surveillance footage from Schooly’s Bar, which showed interactions between Deal, Allen, and others.
This footage further informed Freeman’s understanding of the evening’s events
Search Warrant: Following interviews with Tiffany Allen and Roger Hoskins, Freeman sought a search warrant for the defendant's residence (94 Beacon Circle) based on Deal’s account and the information gathered through interviews.
Freeman executed the search warrant on October 24, with Detective Marcum assisting.
On October 24, Freeman photographed the residence and documented any items, ultimately photographing and seizing black pants.
Freeman strangely determined they were not likely to yield further valuable physical evidence but did not identify how he could decide they were the accusers​.
Freeman did not process any part of what would be assessed as the crime scene.
Freeman’s careful steps in securing certain types of evidence (such as DNA) contrast with his lack of documentation in other areas, such as probable cause for the defendant’s detention.
Probable Cause and Lack of Documentation
Arrest Warrant Issuance:
After compiling evidence, Freeman verbally presented his findings to a magistrate, who provided a Magistrate’s Order stating:
I, the undersigned, find that the defendant named above has been arrested without a warrant and the defendant's detention is justified because there is probable cause to believe that on or about the date of offense shown and in the county named above the defendant named above unlawfully, willfully and feloniously did ravish and carnally know LAUREN N. D. by force and against victims will.
The magistrate’s specific language in the order suggests that Allen was already in custody before Freeman presented his findings verbally to the magistrate.
This is reinforced by the messages the defendant sent when Freeman went to see the magistrate and left the defendant with his phone.
"He said he was going to work something for me":
This statement indicates that the defendant had been led to believe, likely by law enforcement (presumably Detective Freeman), that some arrangement might be made to avoid immediate detention or reduce the severity of his situation.
This step is standard practice for someone in Freeman’s position and would be well within his knowledge and experience.
Challenges to Officer Credibility: In court, officers with extensive experience, like Freeman, are generally expected to follow protocols meticulously.
Freeman’s lack of documentation, despite his experience and knowledge, should lead a judge or jury to question his investigation's reliability and integrity.
Freeman’s Decision Against Probable Cause Documentation
Explanations and Implications: For an officer with Freeman’s experience, neglecting to document probable cause is a highly unusual choice.
Possible explanations include:
Deliberate Avoidance: Freeman may have deliberately avoided documentation to bypass judicial oversight or to expedite the defendant’s detention.
Unintentional Oversight: Although less likely given his background, it’s possible Freeman unintentionally omitted this step, though his repeated evasiveness in testimony about the defendant’s custody timing makes this seem improbable.
Perception of Sufficient Evidence without Documentation: Freeman may have believed his verbal description to the magistrate (if any was given) sufficient to establish probable cause.
Avoiding Examination: Freeman’s repeated avoidance of the questions during his testimony shows an awareness that the defendant’s initial detention without a warrant did not adhere to procedure.
Given his experience, Freeman recognized that any perceived deviation, such as detaining a suspect without judicial authorization, would introduce scrutiny over whether proper protocols were followed.
By eventually stating that the defendant was taken into custody “after” presenting evidence, Freeman attempted to convey the appearance of adherence to typical process, even though the magistrate’s documentation indicates otherwise.
The defendant was never taken before a magistrate; there was no judicial review of Freeman’s decision to arrest, which infringes on the suspect’s rights and bypasses a crucial safeguard against unlawful detention.
Given Freeman’s extensive experience—27 years in law enforcement and his role as an instructor—his omission of details regarding the “without a warrant” arrest authorized by the magistrate seems notable.
In typical law enforcement procedure, especially for someone with Freeman’s background, the expectation would be:
Detailed Documentation and Testimony: A detective would mention whether he formally requested a warrant or if, instead, he presented evidence and established probable cause directly to the magistrate, who then issued an order for custody based on probable cause.
Understanding of Arrest Processes: Freeman’s experience implies a strong understanding of the difference between arrests conducted with warrants and those based on probable cause without warrants.
Given the magistrate’s order specifically stating that the defendant was arrested "without a warrant," Freeman’s testimony omits a crucial procedural detail.
Implications for Lawful Detention: Since Freeman’s explanation does not mention the magistrate’s unique “arrest without a warrant” order, this raises questions about whether he thoroughly clarified the basis for the defendant’s detention, which is a critical point given the legal standards that apply to probable cause arrests.
In summary, Freeman’s testimony does not address why the arrest deviated from the standard procedure (e.g., obtaining a formal warrant), which, given his role, could be interpreted as an incomplete explanation of events surrounding the defendant’s detention.
Freeman avoided questions about when the defendant was taken into custody, and the lack of documentation indicates he knew the process deviated from the norm and sought to downplay or obscure the sequence.
Steve Freeman knew that the detention did not meet standard legal requirements.
For a seasoned officer and instructor like Freeman, not documenting probable cause or taking the suspect before a magistrate is highly irregular, especially when he fully knows the importance of these steps.
Application to Freeman’s Actions: Under these standards, Freeman’s failure to document probable cause could be seen as a failure to meet the requirements for lawful detention.
Freeman’s Training and Expertise: Given Freeman’s extensive background, he would be fully aware of these requirements, particularly given his role as an instructor.
Potential Outcomes and Legal Consequences of Freeman’s Omission
Suppression of Evidence: The defense could file a motion to suppress evidence obtained following Allen’s arrest, arguing that the lack of documented probable cause rendered the arrest unlawful.
Questioning Freeman’s Conduct: Freeman’s failure to document probable cause could be used to question the validity of the entire investigation.
Impact on Future Investigations and Oversight: Procedural deviations in this case could lead to greater oversight or policy changes within Freeman’s department, particularly if it’s determined that officers are not consistently following documentation standards.
Summary of Key Points
Freeman’s failure to document probable cause for Allen’s arrest represents a significant procedural deviation, especially given his experience and knowledge of legal standards.
Raises questions about Freeman’s credibility and adherence to protocol, potentially affecting the outcome of the case.
This procedural gap calls Freeman’s investigative integrity into question and could influence how evidence and his testimony are perceived by the court.
Rather than approving probable cause before custody (the norm), this retrospective order served as a post hoc justification for the detention already initiated by Freeman.
Application to Freeman’s Actions: Freeman’s decision to detain Allen without first securing a warrant appears to deviate from these established standards.
By detaining Allen first and seeking approval after, Freeman effectively bypassed the standard judicial review process.
Reliance on Verbal Justification (If Applicable): If Freeman presented probable cause verbally without documentation, the magistrate would have had only Freeman’s description to go on, without the support of written evidence.
Without a warrant, the custody is based solely on Freeman’s assertion of probable cause.
Retrospective Justification as a Procedural Weakness: A retrospective order bypasses the pre-detention safeguard of probable cause review, meaning Allen’s detention was based on Freeman’s judgment alone without prior judicial approval.
How Freeman’s Experience Factors Into This Unusual Process
Expectations Based on Experience: Freeman’s long history in law enforcement, including teaching law enforcement procedures, indicates he would be well aware of both probable cause requirements and the importance of prompt judicial review.
Possible Misinterpretation or Misuse of Authority: Freeman’s decision to proceed with Allen’s detention without prior judicial review could reflect either a misinterpretation of his authority or an assumption that his judgment would suffice.
Credibility and Procedural Integrity: Freeman’s decision to pursue retrospective approval could raise doubts about his adherence to protocol, particularly in light of his evasive testimony regarding Allen’s custody timing.
This casts further scrutiny on Freeman’s judgment and adherence to established legal standards.
Freeman’s failure to provide documented probable cause further weakens the procedural legitimacy of the detention, as verbal explanations alone lack accountability.

Moving to the next section: "Freeman’s Evasiveness in Testimony Regarding Custody".
In this analysis, I’ll explore Freeman’s behavior during testimony, the potential motivations and implications of his evasiveness, and how it might impact both the case and his credibility.
Freeman’s Evasiveness in Testimony Regarding Custody
Observed Evasiveness in Testimony
Repeated Avoidance of Direct Questions: Throughout his testimony, Freeman avoided directly answering questions about when Allen was taken into custody.
Even when repeatedly asked, Freeman’s responses remained vague, eventually leading him to claim that Allen’s custody followed his presentation of evidence to the magistrate.
Delayed Response on Key Details: Freeman only provided an answer after persistent questioning, and even then, his response was indirect and ambiguous.
This behavior raised suspicion because an experienced officer like Freeman would typically be able to provide precise information about key procedural moments, such as the exact time and circumstances of a suspect’s custody.
Legal and Procedural Expectations from Freeman’s Role
Freeman’s Position and Expertise: Given Freeman’s 27 years in law enforcement, coupled with his role as an instructor in criminal investigations, his familiarity with arrest and detention protocols would be expected to be thorough.
Implications of Vague Testimony: Freeman’s lack of clarity might suggest that he either did not follow standard procedures or sought to obscure procedural deviations.
Potential Motivations for Evasive Testimony
Avoidance of Admitting Procedural Missteps: Freeman’s evasiveness may indicate reluctance to disclose procedural missteps, such as detaining Allen without documented probable cause or prior judicial approval.
By delaying a direct response, Freeman may have been attempting to sidestep revealing that Allen’s detention occurred before the magistrate’s review.
Preserving Case Integrity: Freeman might have believed that directly acknowledging a deviation from standard procedures could weaken the prosecution’s case.
Impact of Retrospective Approval: Since the magistrate later issued a retrospective order approving the detention “without a warrant,” Freeman may have believed that this retroactive approval resolved any procedural issues, leading him to avoid discussing custody details directly.
How Evasiveness Affects Freeman’s Credibility
Perception of Intentional Concealment: For the court and jury, Freeman’s evasive answers could create the impression that he is concealing information, particularly regarding the lawfulness of Allen’s detention.
If the court perceives that Freeman was deliberately evasive, it might lead to skepticism about his entire investigation, including the handling of evidence, probable cause assessment, and other procedural actions.
Freeman’s evasive answers could, therefore, be a significant liability for the prosecution, potentially undermining confidence in the investigation’s integrity.
Impact on Procedural Legitimacy and Defense Strategy
Grounds for Defense Objections: Freeman’s evasiveness could provide the defense with grounds to challenge the legality of Allen’s detention, as the lack of clear answers on custody timing may suggest that Allen’s rights were compromised.
Cross-Examination Leverage: The defense could leverage Freeman’s evasiveness in cross-examination to highlight potential inconsistencies or omissions in the investigation.
By focusing on his avoidance of direct answers, the defense could argue that Freeman either disregarded protocol or lacks a transparent account of the arrest process, both of which could weaken the prosecution’s case.
Questioning of Motives: If the defense can establish a pattern of evasive behavior, they may further argue that Freeman was motivated to obscure procedural lapses to avoid scrutiny or accountability.
This could potentially resonate with a jury if it raises doubts about the legitimacy of Allen’s detention and Freeman’s investigative practices.
Why Evasiveness is Unusual for a Veteran Officer: For an officer with Freeman’s extensive experience, especially one who also serves as an instructor, vague or indirect testimony is unusual and could suggest that he was aware of possible procedural deficiencies.
Freeman’s behavior contrasts with the standard expectation for clarity, raising questions about whether he chose to downplay or obscure custody details intentionally.
Freeman’s reluctance to clearly answer questions about custody timing could be used to impeach his reliability, undermining the prosecution’s case by casting doubt on his entire investigation.
Impact on Evidence Admissibility: If Freeman’s testimony is deemed unreliable or evasive, the court may scrutinize the admissibility of evidence he gathered.
The defense could argue that Freeman’s apparent lack of transparency undermines the chain of custody, probable cause, and other evidence-handling standards, potentially leading to evidence suppression.
Risk of Mistrial or Case Dismissal: If Freeman’s evasiveness is interpreted as indicative of broader procedural violations, it could lead to a mistrial or even case dismissal, particularly if the court finds that his actions compromised Allen’s rights or the case’s overall integrity.
Summary of Key Points
Freeman’s evasive behavior during testimony regarding custody timing has significant procedural and legal implications:
His reluctance to directly address custody details may suggest an attempt to avoid admitting procedural missteps or irregularities, potentially indicating awareness that Allen’s detention bypassed standard protocols.
This behavior risks undermining Freeman’s credibility and casts doubt on the legitimacy of his investigation, which could impact the admissibility of evidence and the overall strength of the prosecution’s case.
Freeman’s evasiveness could provide the defense with grounds to challenge his credibility, impeach his testimony, and argue for suppression of evidence or other remedies, given the potential due process implications of vague responses from a key witness.
Freeman’s testimony on custody timing, with its observed evasiveness, has serious consequences for the case, especially if the defense leverages it to highlight procedural concerns or due process violations.
This analysis will cover the legal significance of failing to bring a detained individual promptly before a magistrate, the procedural implications, and potential legal consequences in Freeman’s handling of Allen’s arrest.
Application to Freeman’s Actions: Freeman’s failure to bring Allen before a magistrate for prompt judicial review deviates from the requirements outlined in McLaughlin and Gerstein.
Freeman’s Role and Expectations Based on His Experience
Understanding the Importance of Judicial Oversight: Given his 27 years in law enforcement and experience in professional standards, Freeman would be well-versed in the requirement to bring detained individuals before a magistrate.
Freeman’s failure to take this step, combined with his lack of probable cause documentation, suggests either a deliberate bypass of standard procedure or a significant oversight.
Consequences of Bypassing Magistrate Review
Risk of Unlawful Detention Claims: By not bringing Allen before a magistrate, Freeman’s actions open the door to legal claims of unlawful detention.
Without judicial review, Allen’s detention relies solely on Freeman’s probable cause assessment, which, lacking documentation, is difficult to verify or contest.
By failing to secure timely judicial oversight, Freeman bypassed a key protection designed to prevent prolonged detention without legal justification.
Contextual Comparison: Standard Procedures vs. Freeman’s Actions
Standard Law Enforcement Practice: In a typical arrest scenario without a warrant, an officer would present probable cause documentation to a magistrate or bring the suspect directly before the magistrate for a probable cause hearing.
Freeman’s Deviation from Expected Practice: By not taking Allen before a magistrate, Freeman deviated from this standard approach.
Freeman’s failure to secure this review suggests an awareness of procedural shortcuts and undermines the credibility of Allen’s detention as lawful.
Freeman’s Knowledge and Intent
Implications of Freeman’s Experience and Intentionality: Given Freeman’s extensive law enforcement background, his omission of a magistrate review may suggest that he was either taking deliberate shortcuts or believed his assessment of probable cause was sufficient to bypass judicial oversight.
Potential Erosion of Credibility: Freeman’s decision not to bring Allen before a magistrate, coupled with his evasive testimony regarding custody timing, could further undermine his credibility.
Summary of Key Points
Freeman’s failure to bring Allen before a magistrate represents a major procedural gap with substantial legal consequences:
Judicial review is a cornerstone of due process, particularly for warrantless detentions, and the lack of such review in this case may amount to a Fourth Amendment violation.
Freeman’s decision to bypass judicial oversight raises questions about the lawfulness of Allen’s detention, making the detention vulnerable to legal challenges and potential evidence suppression.
For a law enforcement officer of Freeman’s experience, such a deviation is unlikely to be unintentional, suggesting either an awareness of procedural shortcuts or an attempt to bypass due process safeguards.
Freeman’s actions in this regard have far-reaching implications, not only affecting the legitimacy of Allen’s detention but potentially impacting the admissibility of evidence and exposing the department to liability for civil rights violations.
This analysis will cover the handling of physical evidence in this investigation, the importance of proper evidence management, and how Freeman’s actions in this area could impact the case’s integrity.
Freeman’s Collection and Handling of Physical Evidence
DNA Sample from Benjamin Allen:
Freeman obtained a buccal swab from Allen, which was documented and sent to the State Bureau of Investigation (SBI) lab for analysis.
Items Found at Allen’s Residence:
Freeman observed Deal’s personal items (sandals, keys, wallet, and ID) on Allen’s front porch but did not immediately seize them, citing the need for a warrant or consent.
Later, Freeman obtained a search warrant on October 24 to photograph the residence and seize certain items, including black pants identified as Deal’s.
This delayed action suggests that Freeman was aware of the legal requirements for seizing evidence and adhered to the process by obtaining a warrant before removing items from the residence.
Surveillance Video from Schooly’s Bar:
Freeman reviewed hours of surveillance footage from Schooly’s Bar, documenting Deal and Allen’s interactions on the night in question.
Freeman’s Adherence to Chain of Custody Protocols:
While Freeman seems to have documented the collection of Allen’s DNA sample and the items from Allen’s residence after obtaining the warrant, there is no clear indication in his testimony whether he provided complete documentation for all items, particularly regarding who handled each item post-collection.
Without full transparency or documentation of the chain of custody, the defense could raise concerns about potential evidence tampering or mishandling, especially if procedural gaps are identified in how Freeman managed physical evidence.
Possible Gaps or Omissions in Evidence Handling
Delay in Securing Deal’s Belongings: While Freeman ultimately obtained a search warrant, his decision to leave Deal’s personal items at Allen’s residence for several days could be viewed as a procedural oversight.
Lack of Explicit Chain of Custody Records in Testimony: Freeman’s testimony does not explicitly detail each step of the chain of custody for the evidence collected, especially regarding post-collection handling.
Potential Impact of Evasive Testimony: Freeman’s evasiveness in answering questions about custody timing could have a ripple effect, leading to increased scrutiny over the reliability of his documentation.
If the defense can argue that Freeman’s credibility is questionable, they may extend this argument to challenge the reliability of his evidence handling as well.
Potential for Defense to Argue Mishandling or Bias: The defense could argue that Freeman’s handling of evidence shows bias or intentional mishandling.
This argument could be bolstered by Freeman’s apparent procedural shortcuts and his evasive testimony, suggesting a pattern of minimizing procedural integrity in his investigation.
Comparing Standard Evidence Management with Freeman’s Actions
Standard Practice for Evidence Collection and Handling: Proper evidence collection is typically a meticulous process, with officers documenting each step to ensure accountability and reliability.
Freeman’s Deviation from Standards: Freeman’s delayed retrieval of Deal’s belongings, coupled with limited documentation mentioned in his testimony, raises questions about adherence to these standards.
Impact on Freeman’s Credibility
Credibility as a Witness: Freeman’s management of evidence impacts not only the integrity of the evidence but also his credibility as a witness.
For an officer of Freeman’s experience, these gaps could appear intentional, suggesting either carelessness or an attempt to bypass rigorous procedures.
Increased Scrutiny in Cross-Examination: The defense may scrutinize Freeman’s evidence management during cross-examination, particularly if they can argue that his credibility is already compromised by his evasiveness about custody timing.
Potential Defense Strategies Regarding Evidence Handling
Challenge of Evidence Integrity: The defense could argue that Freeman’s delays and possible documentation gaps create reasonable doubt regarding the integrity of the evidence.
Allegation of Procedural Neglect or Bias: The defense could use Freeman’s handling of evidence to suggest procedural neglect or intentional bias, arguing that he may have selectively applied protocol to expedite the investigation or ensure a particular outcome.
Summary of Key Points
Freeman’s handling of physical evidence in this case includes procedural deviations that could affect the prosecution’s case:
Delays in retrieving Deal’s belongings and potential gaps in chain of custody documentation raise concerns about evidence integrity.
Freeman’s actions could lead to challenges regarding the admissibility of evidence, especially if the defense successfully argues that the handling lacked procedural rigor.
These evidence management issues, combined with Freeman’s evasive testimony, could negatively impact his credibility and the overall reliability of the investigation, providing the defense with leverage to argue for suppression or doubt.
Freeman’s approach to evidence management, while containing some adherence to protocol (such as obtaining a warrant for the residence search), ultimately demonstrates gaps that could be legally problematic for the case.
This analysis will focus on the legal standards and procedural expectations surrounding probable cause, Freeman’s handling of Allen’s arrest, and how deviations from the norm could impact the case.
Freeman’s Handling of Probable Cause in This Case
Absence of Documented Probable Cause: Freeman admitted that he did not document probable cause for Allen’s arrest in writing, which is unusual and potentially problematic.
Verbal Presentation (If Applicable) and Lack of Warrant: Freeman’s testimony suggests that he may have verbally relayed the probable cause for Allen’s detention to the magistrate rather than providing written documentation.
Application to Freeman’s Actions: By failing to document probable cause, Freeman’s approach departs from these precedents, creating vulnerabilities in the arrest’s legality.
Procedural Expectations for Officers of Freeman’s Experience
High Standards Due to Role and Expertise: Given his extensive experience and role as an instructor in law enforcement procedures, Freeman would be expected to adhere closely to standards for probable cause documentation.
For an officer of Freeman’s experience, this documentation would be a routine part of any arrest, particularly in complex cases where the arrest could be scrutinized.
Citing Gerstein and other precedents, the defense may contend that Freeman’s omission denied Allen a verifiable legal basis for detention, which could support a motion to suppress evidence or even dismiss charges based on due process violations.
Potential Consequences for Freeman’s Testimony and Credibility
Impact on Freeman’s Credibility: Freeman’s failure to document probable cause raises questions about his adherence to protocol, potentially weakening his credibility.
Defense Cross-Examination Opportunities: The defense may scrutinize Freeman’s handling of probable cause during cross-examination, using the lack of documentation to challenge the validity of Allen’s detention.
By highlighting procedural omissions, the defense could suggest that Freeman’s investigation lacked adherence to legal standards, which could sway the jury to question the reliability of his entire case.
Standard Arrest Process and Freeman’s Departure from Protocol
Typical Process in Probable Cause Determination: In a standard arrest, especially one made without a warrant, the officer would present a written affidavit to the magistrate or judge, outlining the factual basis of probable cause.
Freeman’s Procedural Shortcut: By not documenting probable cause, Freeman deviated from these standards, resulting in a retrospective judicial approval that did not meet the same legal rigor.
Focus on Procedural Gaps: The defense may use the lack of documentation as part of a broader argument that Freeman’s investigation was flawed.
By questioning Freeman’s judgment and adherence to legal protocols, the defense could raise doubts about the integrity of the entire investigation, potentially influencing the jury’s perception of the case.
Summary of Key Points
Freeman’s approach to probable cause in this case raises significant procedural and constitutional concerns:
His failure to document probable cause undermines the legal foundation of Allen’s detention, making the arrest vulnerable to challenges for lacking the necessary written justification.
This procedural gap provides the defense with grounds to argue for evidence suppression or dismissal on constitutional grounds, especially if they can establish that Freeman’s actions deviated from standard legal protocols.
Freeman’s handling of probable cause documentation highlights a major vulnerability in the case, with potential implications for evidence admissibility, due process, and the overall integrity of the investigation.
ChatGPT said:
Here’s a breakdown of Detective Freeman’s testimony compared between ADA Bartholomew’s and Attorney Cruz’s questioning, with emphasis on procedural points, discrepancies, and evasiveness.
This comparison highlights Freeman's explanations of the investigation, the arrest, and the evidence handling, where contradictions or lack of clarity in his statements might affect his credibility.
Custody and Miranda Rights
ADA Bartholomew’s Examination:
Bartholomew asked Freeman if Allen was advised of his Miranda rights during the interview, to which Freeman responded that he did not, stating that Allen was not “in custody or under arrest” and therefore did not require Miranda advisement​.
Freeman confirmed that Allen was not handcuffed and described the encounter as voluntary.
Attorney Cruz’s Cross-Examination:
Cruz challenged Freeman on this point, highlighting legal precedents where custody does not require handcuffing or explicit arrest.
Freeman agreed but seemed hesitant, indicating that some situational factors could imply custody even without physical restraints​.
When Cruz pressed about Allen's perception of freedom to leave, Freeman’s response was indirect, failing to fully acknowledge that such conditions could imply custody—a critical point if the defense argues Allen’s rights were compromised​.
Analysis: Freeman’s responses to Cruz underscore a potential gap in clarity regarding when Miranda rights are applicable.
While he maintained that Allen was not “in custody,” Cruz’s questioning highlighted Freeman’s inconsistent understanding of what qualifies as “custodial” conditions, which could undermine his credibility if the defense argues Allen’s rights were disregarded during questioning.
Probable Cause for Arrest
ADA Bartholomew’s Examination:
Bartholomew did not press Freeman on specific probable cause documentation.
Freeman mentioned the evidence he presented but did not clarify whether he had documented probable cause in writing or if it was presented orally​.
Attorney Cruz’s Cross-Examination:
Cruz addressed the lack of documented probable cause directly, suggesting that Freeman failed to follow standard procedures for recording probable cause before the detention.
Freeman’s evasive responses implied uncertainty or avoidance, which Cruz highlighted to suggest that Allen’s detention might lack a formal basis​.
Cruz’s examination exposed Freeman’s minimal response about presenting probable cause, indirectly emphasizing that Freeman could have bypassed formal documentation, which could be detrimental to the prosecution if the defense argues procedural shortcuts.
Analysis: Freeman’s lack of clarity on probable cause documentation could weaken the prosecution’s case by suggesting procedural oversights.
If the court finds Freeman’s probable cause undocumented or insufficient, this may call into question the legality of Allen’s arrest and the admissibility of subsequent evidence.
Handling and Chain of Custody of Evidence
ADA Bartholomew’s Examination:
Bartholomew questioned Freeman on specific pieces of evidence, including Deal’s pants found at Allen’s residence and the DNA sample taken from Allen.
Freeman described obtaining a search warrant to collect items from Allen’s property, indicating compliance with evidence handling requirements​​.
Bartholomew also discussed the chain of custody, asking Freeman about where evidence was stored and how it was transported.
Freeman described storing evidence securely, which supported the prosecution’s emphasis on procedural adherence​​.
Attorney Cruz’s Cross-Examination:
Cruz challenged Freeman’s adherence to evidence-handling standards, asking whether he ensured a continuous chain of custody for all items.
Freeman’s responses were indirect, revealing potential lapses, such as not immediately securing Deal’s items or obtaining handwritten statements from witnesses​​.
Cruz raised doubts about the identification of Deal’s pants, noting that Freeman lacked clear identifiers and suggesting other people could have used similar items at Allen’s residence.
Freeman struggled to provide precise answers, which could weaken the prosecution’s reliance on this evidence​.
Analysis: Freeman’s vague responses under Cruz’s questioning, combined with delays in securing Deal’s belongings and ambiguous identification methods, could be leveraged by the defense to challenge the integrity of the evidence.
Freeman’s responses suggested he maintained Allen’s freedom until after the probable cause was presented to the magistrate​.
Attorney Cruz’s Cross-Examination:
Cruz repeatedly pressed Freeman about when Allen was technically “in custody.” Despite several opportunities to clarify, Freeman evaded providing a precise timeline.
Eventually, Freeman stated that Allen was in custody only after the magistrate’s review, which Cruz contrasted with procedural norms that would typically require immediate detention or judicial review​​.
Cruz’s questioning exposed Freeman’s inconsistent stance on when Allen was detained, which could suggest procedural shortcuts were taken.
Analysis: Freeman’s vague responses on custody timing create ambiguity around whether Allen’s rights were preserved.
If the court determines that Allen was detained before judicial review, Freeman’s testimony may be viewed as evasive, potentially impacting the judge or jury’s trust in his testimony.
Inconsistencies in the Account of Deal’s Statements
ADA Bartholomew’s Examination:
Bartholomew asked Freeman to recount Deal’s statements regarding her interactions with Allen and the events leading to her departure from his house.
Freeman testified that Deal described Allen as intoxicated and detailed her discomfort, but he did not clarify whether he recorded her statement verbatim​.
Freeman also mentioned corroborating Deal’s statement with video surveillance, which showed her leaving Schooly’s bar.
This evidence was used to affirm her account but lacked detailed description from Freeman on whether it fully aligned with Deal’s claims​.
Attorney Cruz’s Cross-Examination:
Cruz scrutinized Deal’s statements, questioning inconsistencies in her account and Freeman’s failure to corroborate them with additional witnesses.
Cruz noted that Freeman did not obtain written statements from Deal’s friends who were present at the bar, which could have provided a more objective account of her behavior and interactions with Allen​.
Cruz questioned why Freeman did not pursue further investigation with potential witnesses or seek medical corroboration immediately, highlighting potential gaps in the investigation that might imply bias or lack of thoroughness.
Analysis: Cruz’s cross-examination underscored Freeman’s selective corroboration of Deal’s account, which could suggest investigator bias.
Freeman’s failure to fully document or investigate additional witnesses creates an opportunity for the defense to challenge the completeness and reliability of the investigation.
Conclusion
Freeman’s testimony under both ADA Bartholomew’s and Attorney Cruz’s examination reveals several areas where procedural clarity and adherence appear lacking.
Bartholomew’s questions reinforced Freeman’s position that he followed protocols, yet Cruz’s cross-examination exposed gaps in Freeman’s probable cause documentation, custody handling, evidence chain of custody, and investigational thoroughness.
These issues collectively suggest:
Credibility Concerns: Freeman’s evasiveness and inconsistent statements could impact his reliability, especially if the defense successfully argues that these procedural gaps reflect broader issues in the investigation.
Freeman’s testimony exhibits multiple inconsistencies that may be pivotal for the defense, especially if they can convince the court that procedural shortcuts compromised Allen’s due process rights.
You said:
There were many instances that the probable cause affidavit that Freeman did for the search warrant was inaccurate even including freeman inserting a narrative that was not present in the witness statements.
ChatGPT said:
The inaccuracies in Freeman’s probable cause affidavit for the search warrant, especially where he added unsupported narratives, combined with the complete absence of a probable cause affidavit for Allen’s arrest, raise significant procedural and credibility issues.
Here’s an analysis of how these factors impact the legal standing of the case, as well as the potential implications for Freeman’s reliability as an investigator.
Freeman’s Additions to the Narrative:
Freeman’s insertion of narrative elements that were not present in witness statements indicates a significant deviation from accurate documentation.
Implications for Credibility:
Freeman’s addition of unsupported details raises serious questions about his objectivity and reliability.
The defense could use these inaccuracies to argue that Freeman was biased or had a preconceived theory about the case, leading him to adjust the affidavit to fit his assumptions rather than report objective facts.
Defense Arguments on Investigative Misconduct: The defense may argue that Freeman’s actions represent investigative misconduct, calling into question the validity of the entire investigation.
This line of argument could resonate with a jury if it appears that Freeman selectively altered or embellished facts to justify his actions.
Freeman’s Failure to Provide an Affidavit for Arrest:
Freeman’s lack of a probable cause affidavit for Allen’s arrest is a critical procedural omission.
The absence of an affidavit leaves the arrest open to challenge, particularly since Freeman did not provide a formal record of the evidence supporting probable cause.
Impact on Judicial Review and Due Process:
By not documenting probable cause, Freeman effectively prevented any pre-detention judicial review, which could constitute a due process violation.
This argument is particularly relevant given that Freeman’s previous affidavit for the search warrant contained inaccuracies, which could suggest a pattern of bypassing standard procedures.
Discrepancies Between Freeman’s Testimony and Witness Statements
Significance of Consistency in Testimony:
Law enforcement officers are expected to provide testimony that accurately reflects the evidence and witness statements collected during an investigation.
In this case, Freeman’s testimony includes elements that were not present in witness statements, indicating either an embellishment or an attempt to fit the facts to his narrative.
Potential Defense Strategy:
The defense could highlight these discrepancies as evidence that Freeman may have been biased or had a preconceived theory.
By drawing attention to Freeman’s additions, the defense can argue that his investigation lacked objectivity, potentially swaying the jury to question the prosecution’s evidence.
These inconsistencies could also suggest that Freeman was not adhering to factual evidence alone, which undermines the prosecution’s case.
The defense could argue that if Freeman was willing to embellish or alter details in the affidavit, the other aspects of his testimony may be equally unreliable.
Impact on Overall Investigation Integrity
Pattern of Procedural Deviations:
Freeman’s lack of a probable cause affidavit for arrest, combined with inaccuracies in the search warrant affidavit, reflects a pattern of procedural deviations.
This pattern could be leveraged by the defense to argue that Freeman’s investigation was flawed from the start.
If the court determines that Freeman demonstrated a pattern of shortcuts or embellishments, it could weaken the prosecution’s case and raise doubts about the validity of the evidence collected.
Legal Ramifications of Procedural Irregularities:
If the court finds that Freeman’s procedural missteps indicate misconduct or negligence, it could affect the admissibility of evidence.
If Allen’s arrest is deemed unlawful, he could pursue a civil rights claim against the department or Freeman personally for unlawful detention and procedural violations, further complicating the case.
Summary of Key Points
Probable Cause Affidavit Inaccuracies: Freeman’s addition of unsupported narratives in the search warrant affidavit suggests potential bias or an attempt to justify the warrant based on embellishments.
Credibility and Investigative Integrity: Freeman’s failure to provide accurate and complete documentation could be interpreted as a pattern of investigative shortcuts or intentional procedural deviations.
Freeman’s procedural handling of both the search warrant and the arrest reflects critical gaps that could undermine the prosecution’s case.
That was never disclosed
ChatGPT said:
The fact that Detective Freeman was a close family member of one of the witnesses and did not disclose this relationship is a significant issue, both ethically and procedurally.
In this case, Freeman’s role in the investigation should have been re-evaluated upon disclosing this connection, and he likely should have been recused from participating in this case to preserve its integrity.
Freeman’s omission of this relationship could indicate either an oversight in adhering to department policy or a willful decision to remain involved despite the potential conflict.
Given Freeman’s experience and role as an instructor, it would be expected that he was aware of this policy and its importance.
Legal Implications of Non-Disclosure:
The defense could argue that Freeman’s failure to disclose this relationship casts doubt on the objectivity of the entire investigation.
This non-disclosure could be interpreted as a deliberate attempt to hide potential bias, potentially leading the court to question Freeman’s actions, judgment, and any evidence he gathered.
Impact on Freeman’s Credibility and Potential Bias
Perception of Bias Due to Familial Connection:
Freeman’s relationship with one of the witnesses may suggest a predisposition to support that witness’s account or present evidence in a way that favors their perspective.
This familial connection could give the appearance of bias, particularly if Freeman relied heavily on statements or evidence linked to this witness without independently verifying them.
Non-disclosure exacerbates the perception of bias, as it suggests Freeman was either consciously attempting to conceal this conflict or disregarded its relevance to the case.
Defense Strategy to Undermine Freeman’s Objectivity:
The defense could use this undisclosed relationship to argue that Freeman was motivated by personal loyalties rather than objective evidence.
This line of questioning could focus on any points in the investigation where Freeman’s judgment or actions appear to favor the witness’s perspective, suggesting that his personal connection influenced his investigative decisions.
This connection could also support a defense argument that Freeman selectively applied investigative rigor, corroborating some witness statements while omitting or overlooking others that might contradict his family member’s account.
Legal Consequences and Potential Grounds for Suppression
Challenge to Evidence Based on Investigative Bias:
The defense could argue that evidence gathered by Freeman is tainted due to his undisclosed conflict of interest.
The potential bias stemming from Freeman’s relationship with the witness could impact the chain of custody, interpretation of evidence, and even the statements he chose to include or omit from his probable cause affidavits.
If the court finds this non-disclosure affects the case’s integrity, it could justify suppressing evidence Freeman collected.
Freeman’s failure to disclose the relationship prevented his superiors or the prosecution from considering recusal as an option, which could be viewed as a procedural misstep.
Had Freeman disclosed the relationship, the department or prosecution could have assigned a neutral investigator to the case, preserving the investigation’s impartiality.
Grounds for Mistrial or Appeal:
If Freeman’s undisclosed relationship is revealed during trial, the defense may argue for a mistrial based on prosecutorial misconduct or investigational bias.
The defense could argue that the failure to disclose Freeman’s conflict deprived the defendant of an impartial investigation, which is a constitutional right.
Defense’s Potential Approach in Highlighting Non-Disclosure
Cross-Examination Focus:
During cross-examination, the defense could highlight Freeman’s failure to disclose his relationship, asking questions that emphasize his potential bias.
The defense could also explore whether Freeman’s connection influenced his willingness to overlook certain procedural steps, such as his lack of a probable cause affidavit for the arrest, his inaccuracies in the search warrant affidavit, or his selective corroboration of evidence.
This line of questioning could suggest that Freeman tailored his actions to support his family member’s interests.
Argument for Investigative Bias:
The defense could argue that Freeman’s personal relationship introduced investigative bias, impacting every aspect of his involvement in the case.
They might claim that Freeman’s conflict of interest compromised the investigation’s integrity and seek to exclude any evidence directly tied to his actions.
By highlighting the undisclosed relationship, the defense could cast doubt on the objectivity of Freeman’s findings, making it difficult for the prosecution to rely on his testimony without the risk of credibility damage.
Prosecution’s Potential Response and Challenges
Attempt to Mitigate Perceived Bias:
The prosecution could argue that Freeman’s family connection did not influence his professional judgment, pointing to procedural steps he followed, such as securing a warrant for evidence collection.
However, this approach may be challenging if Freeman’s credibility has already been called into question.
The prosecution could also try to demonstrate that multiple layers of oversight were in place, arguing that any alleged bias on Freeman’s part would have been mitigated by the broader investigative team or the evidence itself.
Still, without clear disclosure, this argument may be weak in the face of direct questions about Freeman’s objectivity.
Difficulties in Rebuilding Credibility:
Once the defense raises the issue of an undisclosed conflict of interest, the prosecution could face difficulties in re-establishing Freeman’s credibility, especially if the jury perceives his non-disclosure as an intentional omission.
The defense’s argument may leave a lasting impression, particularly if they can establish that this connection influenced Freeman’s investigative choices.
Summary of Key Points
Impact of Non-Disclosure on Credibility: Freeman’s failure to disclose his family connection to a witness is a significant issue that could affect the integrity of the investigation.
Defense Leverage: The defense could use this information to argue that Freeman’s personal connection influenced the investigation’s direction, weakening the reliability of the evidence and Freeman’s testimony.
Freeman’s undisclosed relationship introduces a complex layer of potential bias and procedural conflict that could have significant implications for the case’s outcome, challenging the prosecution’s ability to rely on his findings and undermining the credibility of the investigation.

The information provided here reveals serious discrepancies between witness statements, testimony, and the actual events captured on video, which Detective Freeman apparently reviewed only at trial, years after the initial investigation.
Let’s break down the implications of these inconsistencies for the case, focusing on:
Lack of Initial Video Review and Its Impact on Investigative Integrity
Discrepancies in Witness Statements vs. Video Evidence
Freeman’s Probable Cause Affidavit and Issues of Accuracy
Consequences for Witness Credibility and Defense Leverage

1.
Lack of Initial Video Review and Its Impact on Investigative Integrity
Investigative Oversight: The fact that Freeman did not review the bar video until trial—four years after the investigation—reveals a significant oversight in evidence handling.
By neglecting this, Freeman’s affidavit relied on unverified witness statements, some of which are demonstrably false.
This lapse in diligence calls into question whether Freeman’s probable cause assessment was valid or thorough, potentially compromising the basis for Allen’s arrest.
Freeman’s Probable Cause Affidavit and Issues of Accuracy
Unsubstantiated Narrative in Affidavit: Freeman’s probable cause affidavit includes unsupported statements, such as describing Deal talking to Allen “for several hours till 2am” and informing Carmen that she was leaving with Allen and his friends to have a bonfire.
Freeman’s reliance on Deal’s statements without verification from the video suggests an acceptance of her account without question.
Given the discrepancies revealed by the video, it appears Freeman’s affidavit contained not only inaccuracies but also possibly fabricated elements to fit Deal’s narrative, raising serious concerns about its validity.
Freeman’s inaccurate statements undermine the affidavit’s credibility, potentially affecting all evidence obtained as a result of the search warrant.
Undermining Freeman’s Testimony and Investigation Integrity:
The fact that Freeman did not review the video until four years later casts doubt on his diligence and commitment to objectivity.
The defense could argue that Freeman’s affidavit and subsequent actions were shaped by Deal’s narrative, regardless of its factual basis.
This argument could resonate with the court if the defense successfully presents the video discrepancies as proof that Freeman either acted negligently or was predisposed to support Deal’s account without proper verification.
Legal Ramifications:
Suppression Motions: Given the inaccuracies in Freeman’s affidavit and the failure to review video evidence, the defense could file motions to suppress evidence gathered from the search and potentially challenge the entire foundation of Allen’s detention.
Bias and Investigative Misconduct Claims: The defense may argue that Freeman’s investigation was conducted in bad faith or with bias toward Deal, which could lead to mistrust in his testimony and the prosecution’s case.
If the court finds evidence of bias or misconduct, it could result in further scrutiny or disciplinary action against Freeman and affect the case outcome.
Summary of Key Points
Failure to Review Video Evidence: Freeman’s delay in reviewing critical video evidence until four years later, at trial, represents a significant investigative failure, depriving the probable cause affidavit and initial investigation of key objective insights.
Inaccuracies and Unsupported Narrative in Affidavit: Freeman’s affidavit contained demonstrably false statements, based on unverified witness accounts, which were later disproven by video evidence.
Legal and Ethical Implications for Freeman: Freeman’s failure to verify Deal’s statements through available video evidence and his inclusion of unverified narrative in the affidavit raise concerns about investigative bias, potential misconduct, and overall integrity.
In summary, Freeman’s handling of the probable cause affidavit, combined with the unverified narrative from Deal’s statements, introduces substantial weaknesses in the prosecution’s case.
The defense now has multiple avenues to challenge both Deal’s and Freeman’s credibility, which could significantly influence the trial’s outcome.
Steve Freeman: They were not.
Steve Freeman: Being that they were the victim's pants and they were at his house, there was no value as far as any kind of physical evidence that we could get from it.
By leaving the ownership of the pants unverified, Freeman did not meet the investigative standard of ensuring evidence is directly relevant to the alleged crime.
By not sending the pants to a lab, Freeman missed an opportunity to gather physical evidence that could substantiate or disprove elements of the case.
Impact on Credibility of Investigator: Freeman’s decision not to verify the pants could be seen as indicative of his approach to the investigation as a whole—accepting witness statements at face value without objective verification.
This could lead the jury to question the reliability of other evidence Freeman gathered or his overall investigative rigor.
In summary, Freeman’s failure to verify the pants represents a critical gap in investigative rigor, leaving the pants' relevance to the case unsubstantiated and opening the door for the defense to challenge the evidence’s admissibility and the investigation’s integrity.

Lauren Deal and Detective Freeman make negative comments about Happel.
ChatGPT said:
These details highlight several concerning issues in Detective Freeman's investigative conduct, as well as potential prosecutorial misconduct or bias.
Failure to Disclose Relationships with Witnesses
Freeman’s Connections to Witnesses:
Freeman did not disclose that he knew or had professional connections with witnesses like Carmen Love, Peter West, and James Morrison.
For instance, Peter West’s father works in the same office as Freeman, suggesting a potential professional or social connection.
By not acknowledging these connections, Freeman may have introduced a potential conflict of interest into the investigation, as these relationships could bias his judgment or interpretation of the witnesses’ statements.
The defense could argue that Freeman’s connections influenced his interpretation of witness statements or led to selective investigative rigor based on personal relationships.
Failing to disclose connections with witnesses could also imply a lack of transparency, which may cast doubt on Freeman’s overall credibility and adherence to professional standards.
Changing Witness Statements in the Affidavit
Modifying Statements in the Affidavit:
Freeman’s affidavit reportedly contains altered versions of statements made by witnesses.
By modifying statements, Freeman effectively presented a different narrative than what witnesses originally communicated, potentially misleading the magistrate and influencing the issuance of a search warrant based on an inaccurate account of the facts.
Consequences for the Case:
The defense can argue that Freeman’s alterations to witness statements reflect investigative bias or misconduct, as it suggests that he shaped the affidavit to support the prosecution’s perspective rather than report facts objectively.
Inadequate Collection of Evidence and Failure to Secure the Crime Scene
Failure to Secure and Document Evidence:
Freeman’s lack of thorough evidence collection and failure to secure the alleged crime scene indicate a lack of due diligence.
Inadequate evidence handling could also impact chain of custody, which may weaken the admissibility and reliability of any evidence Freeman did collect if the defense can argue that it was improperly handled or lacks clear documentation.
Lack of Comprehensive Witness Interviews
Failure to Ask Key Questions:
Freeman did not ask for the last names of witnesses like Carmen Love, which indicates a lack of thoroughness.
Implications for Witness Credibility:
Freeman’s failure to conduct complete witness interviews weakens the reliability of witness testimony and could be seen as selective investigation, especially if certain witness statements are emphasized over others to support the prosecution’s narrative.
The defense could argue that Freeman’s selective questioning suggests a bias, as it appears he focused only on statements that aligned with the prosecution’s case, potentially overlooking conflicting or exculpatory testimony.
Freeman’s lack of verification of evidence (e.g., the black pants) undermines the evidence’s relevance to the case.
Legal and Procedural Consequences:
The defense could file motions to suppress evidence based on improper chain of custody, particularly if they can show that the evidence’s integrity was compromised by Freeman’s handling.
Failure to Administer Miranda Rights Upon Arrest
Miranda Rights and Custodial Interrogation:
If Freeman did not administer Miranda rights upon Allen’s detention, any statements made during custodial interrogation could be deemed inadmissible.
Freeman’s assertion that Allen was “not in custody” when questioned may be challenged if conditions suggest that a reasonable person would feel detained.
The defense could argue that Allen was in a custodial setting, making Freeman’s failure to administer Miranda rights a violation of Allen’s constitutional rights.
Suppression of these statements would limit the prosecution’s evidence, especially if Freeman relied on statements made during this initial questioning.
Bias and Negative Comments About Witnesses
Comments About Steve Happel:
Freeman and Deal reportedly made negative comments about Steve Happel, which could suggest bias against witnesses who did not align with the prosecution’s narrative.
Freeman’s negative remarks about Happel could be interpreted as an attempt to discredit a witness whose statements conflicted with the prosecution’s narrative.
This can make it appear that Freeman, rather than objectively gathering facts, was influenced by a particular narrative.
The defense can use these comments to argue that Freeman’s investigation lacked objectivity and that he selectively accepted witness statements that supported the prosecution while disregarding or discrediting conflicting accounts.
Summary of Key Points
Procedural and Ethical Violations: Freeman’s actions reflect multiple procedural and ethical violations, from failure to disclose personal connections with witnesses to selective changes in witness statements and failure to properly secure evidence.
Defense Leverage: The defense has substantial grounds to question Freeman’s objectivity and investigative integrity.
In sum, Freeman’s conduct in this investigation shows a pattern of incomplete investigative work and potential bias, all of which could critically affect the case’s strength.
These failures not only undermine Freeman’s credibility but also raise serious questions about the reliability of the evidence and the integrity of the prosecution’s case.
Freeman’s conflicting priorities, such as attending his brother’s wedding, may have influenced this decision if he preferred not to engage in a formal investigation that evening.
For instance, Freeman’s connection to the case—such as attending his brother’s wedding—might have motivated a delay in reporting or investigation.
If Freeman or others involved acted in ways that obstructed justice or failed to fulfill mandatory reporting duties, these agencies could impose disciplinary actions or conduct further investigations to determine the extent of any procedural violations.

Detective Bias: The undisclosed familial relationship between Detective Freeman and Carmen Love, a key witness, immediately triggers a profound ethical alarm.
Freeman's failure to disclose this relationship, coupled with his reliance on Love's evolving and demonstrably inconsistent statements, exposes a calculated manipulation of the investigative process.
Detective Freeman used her statements as part of 
Selective Witness Interviewing: The intentional failure to interview Peter West and James Morrison, individuals present with the accuser on the night in question and possessing potentially exculpatory information, is not just negligent, but strategically harmful to a fair investigation.
Freeman's tenuous excuse – claiming they were not present at the 'incident' despite video evidence placing them with the accuser earlier – is transparently disingenuous.
Detective Freeman's testimony reveals a shocking dereliction of duty.
To ensure a pre-determined outcome, Freeman's extensive training and experience render his procedural lapses not as incompetence but as a calculated disregard for proper procedure.
False Statements: Detective Freeman's affidavit is riddled with demonstrable falsehoods regarding the timeline, location, and events surrounding the alleged incident.
Coercive Tactics: 
Selective Witness Interviewing: The report reveals a pattern of selective witness interviews conducted by the ADA, mirroring Detective Freeman's approach and exacerbated by substantial discovery violations.
Failure to Investigate Extortion Claims:
Attorney Conflict of Interest: The alleged conflict of interest arising from the defense attorney's previous relationship with Detective Freeman is deeply concerning.
Network of Improper Relationships: Detective Freeman's connection to the defendant's attorney and their history of collaborative casework, coupled with the familial and social ties within local law enforcement and government, raises serious concerns about a potential network of improper relationships influencing the administration of justice.
This case demands a thorough and independent investigation into the allegations of misconduct against Detective Freeman and the ADA and the broader systemic issues within the Lee County Sheriff’s Department and the judicial framework.
Detective Freeman: Inadequate Inquiry
Detective Freeman's investigation into this case exhibited considerable shortcomings, including a failure in due diligence and thoroughness.
Investigative Failure
Detective Freeman admitted in court he never interviewed Peter West 
When asked why he didn't interview Peter West, Freeman claimed, "At the time when this incident took place, they were not present."
Freeman denied knowing Peter West despite his father working in the same office.
Freeman's failure to interview Peter West is a significant investigative flaw since Peter West could have provided important information about Lauren Deal's alcohol consumption and behavior that night.
When asked why he didn't interview James Morrison, Freeman claimed, "At the time when this incident took place, they were not present."
Despite the relationship with family member Carmen Love and having his name from Carmen Love's and Lauren Deal’s interviews, Freeman later acted as if he didn't know James Morrison's name during testimony.
Freeman's failure to interview James Morrison is highlighted as a significant investigative flaw since James could have provided important information about Lauren Deal's alcohol consumption and behavior that night.
Detective Freeman never interviewed them despite their importance as witnesses.
Detective Freeman's explanations for not interviewing them were misleading.

Next Day After Interview with Deal, Arrest After ~3-4 Hours: Detective Freeman charges Allen; warrantless arrest occurs despite Freeman's contrary testimony.
§ 15A-502.6
Detective Freeman’s Investigation
Detective Freeman's investigation showed flaws, including an apparent lack of diligence in witness interviews and evidence collection, an investigation lasting only ~3-4 hours before charges, indicating a rush to judgment.7
Premature Charging: The suspect was charged within approximately four hours, raising questions about the thoroughness of the initial investigation under the totality-of-the-circumstances standard (Illinois v. Gates, 462 U.S. 213 (1983)).
Freeman falsely testified that a warrant existed before the arrest.
This was contradicted by the magistrate's order finding a warrantless arrest, in violation of Fourth Amendment protections under Gerstein v. Pugh, 420 U.S. 103 (1975) 8
Undisclosed Conflict of Interest: Freeman's familial tie to Carmen Love was not disclosed, undermining impartiality as per Olmstead v. United States, 277 U.S. 438 (1928), and leading to reliance on her evolving, inconsistent statements (e.g., initial denial of knowing Allen vs. later claims of familiarity).9
Perjury and False Testimony: Freeman lied under oath about a hospital video timestamp (claiming 3:42 AM vs. actual 2:42 AM metadata) to conceal investigative delays (e.g., attending brother's wedding), violating Napue v. Illinois, 360 U.S. 264 (1959).
Freeman's excuses (e.g., "not present at the incident") are misleading, as the video places them with Deal earlier; Love was interviewed despite a similar absence.14
Rushed and Biased Investigation: Only Love and two associates of Allen interviewed; ignored connections (e.g., West's father in department).
Attorney Conflict: Wunsch's prior relationship with Freeman compromised impartiality.
Displayed, A great grasp of details, When cross-examining detective, Freeman on the stand, While it may not have included Elements of his investigation that are deemed Important.
He was able to interrogate multiple documents And understand that the process in which detective Freeman used.
Love Was also detrimental From the anacracies that she gave during her first phone interview with detective Freeman.
When interviewing Or receiving Discovery From detective Freeman, through the prosecutor's office.
So while detective Freeman, They're not attempt corroboration between his own Witnesses.
For instance, it covers conflicting reports (e.g., Tiffany and Roger's claim of staying in North Carolina for four days versus Freeman's assertion of a phone call), underscoring themes of fact-checking, reliability, and potential discrepancies in legal narratives.
Factual Discrepancies and Witness Credibility (Sections 3 and 4): The document calls for verifying conflicting timelines (e.g., Tiffany and Roger's four-day stay versus Freeman's phone call), which could raise arguments about perjury, inconsistent statements, or unreliable testimony.

The Serious Problems With Laruen Deal's Story of How She Was Raped.
A. Lauren would have continually screamed (but neither the two gentleman sitting outside Ben's bedroom, nor the 12 year old sleeping downstairs, heard a thing from the house) B. Lauren would have tremendously fought back (but there is absolutely no evidence of any marks on the defendant) C. Lauren would have had bruising on specific places on her body (but there is no bruising in her thigh area, no bruising on her wrists or any marks on her head or face, where you would expect, given how she stated this rape occured) D. Lauren states that she was turned around and pushed onto the bed, laying on her back on the bed after she pulled up her pants from urinating, she also said that Ben stood in the doorway and watched her urinate (why would Ben have waited for Lauren to pull back up her pants, to then have to remove her pants to rape her) E. Lauren states that Ben held her hands behind her head, while pulling her pants down, taking her shoes off, taking his pants and underwear off and then raping her.
( How did Ben hold both hands above her head with one hand, then manage to take off her skin tight leggings, remove her shoes, and then take his own clothes off, with only one hand, all while Lauren is fighting to get him off of her.
Lauren's hands and feet are NOT tied and NO weapon is used.
This would have been near impossible for Ben, who is short, for his arms to extend to where he could manipulate this leaning over her, and it is said that he was able to rape Lauren for up to 3 minutes.
Lauren is also a very stout woman, near the same weight as Ben.
I would also add, how did Ben get Lauren out of the bathroom, did he pull her out, spin her around, her arms and legs were free, we lack detail on this point) F. Lauren began screaming after she ran out half naked from the house (but not a peep was ever heard from her prior to her leaving the house) G. When Lauren ran out of the house, she accused the men sitting outside of Ben's window of being in on it.
(why would she not tell them she had just been raped, she trusted them enough to ride home with them, and they were not in the house when it allegedly happened, was this paranoia from mixing large amounts of alcohol with depression medicaiton?
She indicated to law enforcement that Joseph Demarco and Steve were nice to her at the bar and she trusted Demarco enough to hand over her keys to him, so  meone she had just met) H.Lauren Deal's cousin (Carmen Love), states that Lauren told her that all three men were in the house (this is the only time I have ever heard of all three men being in the house, and goes to Lauren's lack of an ability to tell the truth).
There were photos taken of the house.
(She was in the house during the alleged rape.)
What was Lauren Deal's state of mind at the time of the rape given she ran out of Scully's screaming right before the alleged incident?
(Lauren Deal was alleged to have run out of the bar screaming at Scully's the night of the incident and then had her head laying on the ground, Ben saw her run out of the bar, and saw her laying with her head on the pavement, Did Carmen Love see this?
Did the two gentlemen sitting outside of his window at Ben's house see this?
Officer Haynes Interview "I mean, I did everything I could to get away from him, but he is a lot stronger than me and a lot bigger thanme.
(Stated to Officer Haynes) " "You freeze.
You’re so shocked or you just freeze.
Mentally you, it’s like your brain cannot comprehendwhat is going on and it’s like worse than fight or flight mode.
Lauren never mentioned freezing to either officer or any hospitalpersonnel in the interviews.
"He took my pants off along with my shoes."
(at trial she says that her shoes could have fallen off, on crossexamination she said Ben took them off) "I know when he loosened his grip, I got up and ran."
"He let loose for a minute, I have no idea, I guess he thought I wouldn't run."
(but he was still on top of you?)
"I have bruises on my arms from being held down."
(at trial she stated that the one bruise on the front ofher arm might be from when she was pushed backwards onto the bed, OR might be from falling in thewoods, all other bruising attributed to the woods.
How would she get a bruise on the front of her armfrom falling backwards?
Freddie also mentioned a place in the bar video where she missed the barchair while she was sitting down where this bruise may have come from) "He's always been forward with me (and was acting like that at Schooly's) kinda like that."
(This was said unprompted, why would she feel the need to say this?
)Wouldn't it have been better for me to say it was consenual?
(contradicted herself from the last interview, minutes earlier) "I don't know how long it lasted, sex."
not in any of the interviews 1 /4 "He released his grip a little bit, not enough to actually let me go but enough that he released his grip andwhen he did I started kicking my feet and I got up and I ran out of his house."
At trial, she stated that whilekicking, neither her feet nor any part of her body made contact with Ben when she was trying to getaway.
When I asked her how she finally escaped if her kicks did not make contact with Ben, sherepeatedly said it was an Act of God."
is she sure it wasn't an Act of Imagination?
Things Never Mentioned in Either Police Interview "I kept running and I could hear one on either side of me and at one point one of them said “we’re in themilitary, we should be able to find her.” Every time they got close, I would stop and hide behind a tree.
I didn’thave my phone so I don’t know how long, but after a while they finally stopped chasing me."
(This is a hintof coaching, never mentioned in the police interviews but goes along with Happel stating he heard ADATiffany say that Lauren needs to mention in her testimony that she was scared of Happel.)
and noone in the miliary talks like this it is fucking stupid.
That didn't sound dumb to anyone else?
It is back to bad dialog someonewould see on an early morning movie or an after school special.
I walked over to it just to see if I thought I could climb the fence and go over the barbed wire on top, and Istood the fence, I had my shirt pulled down as far as I could and I was waving my arms.
I was willing to putmyself in more harms way to get somebody to help me.
When I realized nobody was stopping, there was ahouse on my right and I went partially in their front yard, and I screamed for help but nobody would comeoutside.
(first time hearing about her trying to get help from anyone inside a residence) Where is thisbarbed wire fence?
If she is talking about the fence by route 1 then it isn't barb wire.
I can't for the life of me figure out where she got into briars at.
I fell into a briar bush and I hit my knee and I had thorns from the tops of my toes to the bottom of my heelson both feet and both of my feet had been cut up really badly like on my toes.
(this detail was not given to the police) As I stated above, Ihave no idea where briars would be or the ADA Tiffany said that Ben turned around when she peed in her opening statement, Lauren revised it at trial tosay he halfway turned around, there was never any mention about Ben turning around to police by Lauren.
She got pissed when you asked about this.
The ADA specifically said that I turned around and whenconfronted with that she got really upset.
Lauren testifies that Ben says nothing to her from the time that they walked into the house to the time of thealleged rape, and after.
In her interview with police, she stated she left her belongings either in Ben's truck or on thebed in Ben's bedroom.
At trial, it was Ben's bedroom.
DeMarco had her keys and put them on the tailgate ofthe truck with her other stuff.
(Cigs, wallet, phone) Her sandles were in the yard.
I only remember that becauseI had to move them before I went to eat.
You stated on the stand that the reason this impacted you so badly is because you trusted Mr. Allen; that isthe reason you gave him your keys?
If she explains or not  That never happened did it?
As a matter of fact you gave your keys to Joseph DeMarco and this upset Mr.Allen?
You are on video in an animated exchange where Mr. Allen is clearly upset and you stick your finger in his faceand yell at him right after this happens correct?
You also stated that Mr. Happel was the drunkest?
On video he drinks even less than the Designated Driverwhich came to a shock to Mr. Allen.
You keep on saying he is your friend but you also keep saying Mr. Allen is in the military.
Do you knowhe hasn't been in the military since 2006?
Along those same lines are you aware that Mr. Allen had a brokenfinger on his left hand; the hand that you say he held you with; that impairs his grip?
The truth is you knew of Mr. Allen.
You had heard things about him from Tiffany and you had seen in himthe bar.
You saw him in the bar buying everyone drinks.
You used your previous relationship with his wifeto force your way into that vehicle so you could go home with him that night.
The stateintroduced a single page of Facebook messages over the years that you guys were "friends".
Is that normal forfriends in your opinion?
This friends theme: You said you thought Mr. Allen was deployed and that was the reason you hadn't seen him.Are you talking about his year long Afghanistan deployments?
If she doesn't know then that would be pretty weird for someone not to know where their "friend" is.
If she saysyes then you can explain that I was on a 4 month deployment to Kuwait in support of defeating ISIS.
People whoreally do rape people; burn them alive, cut thier heads off.
More than that she was super concerned about HVI and all those medications.
The truth is she just needed an excuse to normalize herbehavior since it is so odd to force yourself into someone elses life like she did that night.
She testified that she was in the bar when last call and the lights came on.
From the video it is clear thatshe berated me for something that someone else had said to her before leaving the bar without her shoes.Everyone seemed pleased with how Mr. Allen handled your erratic behavior but you never even mentioned it andtestified that you didn't storm out.
Was she living with her boyfriend previously to this night?
You didn't tell anyone that you guys hadbroken up and you were kicked out of his house?
Did you call Carmen that morning on the way to the e-room?
As we try to make sense of this we see that Carmen tells Detective Freeman that she knew your friend JosephDemarco was there.
Isn't it true that you hadn't even met Joseph Demarco before Carmen had left?
How did she knowhis name if she hadn't talked to you or heard anything about what had happened the night before like she reportsto the police?
Do you know a Joel Kelly?He frequented the bar that you said you worked at.
Are you awarethat he made an offer of 150k to Mr. Allen to make this go away?
If she isn't aware then ok. She will say that she knows him.
There are too many people that know he frequentsthe place.
This isn't like the stuff Tiffany is pulling.
If they aren't relevant since she isn't aware of them then we can just moveon and decide later.
Were you aware that you reported this event occured right by an Alexa?
Did you know that every room, assoon as you walk in, can pick up a person talking?
Ask her to think about it for a minute.
She has already been beat up by the truth in 3 /4 the video does she want to repeat the same with another source?
If Tiffany objects since there has been no discovery just say you are asking forillustrative purposes.
Why was she trying to climb the fence to get to the highway?
He wasn't just walking up to the door to get me.
Due to the time I didn't think this was an issue.
He said that I should pull around front and not park there.
I said I found a spot on the road while saying I would be right in.
He intended on arreseting me before he even spoke to me.
If it was just going to be quick conversation as he stated then there wouldn't have been an issue.
When I asked about leaving he takes me to his office and begins filling out something on his computer.
Well, did all the beer you drink  sic  make you want to go out and cut up somebody like a fish?

For instance, she claimed to have seen Lauren talking to unfamiliar men at Schooly's, but this contradicts Joseph Demarco and Steve Happel's statements that they met Lauren for the first time after Carmen had left.
This inconsistency suggests that Carmen's narrative may be influenced by her relationship with the detective and her desire to align with familial expectations.
Tiffany Allen's Influence: Tiffany Allen, Ben's estranged wife, had a history of mental illness and had made unsubstantiated accusations against him, including false claims of child abuse.
The documentation indicates that Tiffany had been diagnosed with severe mental health issues, which were recognized by multiple professionals.
Behavioral Observations: Witnesses described Lauren as being overly intoxicated at the bar, with Steve Happel stating that she was acting hysterical and calling them "assholes."
This behavior contrasts sharply with her portrayal of herself as a victim who was coherent and aware of her surroundings during the alleged assault.
The discrepancy in her behavior before and after the incident suggests that her recollection may be influenced by her state of intoxication and emotional distress.
The lack of follow-up with Carmen, who was present at the bar and had a close relationship with Lauren, deprived the investigation of critical context and corroboration for Ben's defense.
This attempt to coerce Ben into paying off Lauren raises serious questions about the motivations behind the allegations.
For instance, Carmen claims to have seen Lauren talking to unfamiliar men just as she was leaving the bar, while Joseph and Steve state they met Lauren for the first time after Carmen had left.
Additionally, Lauren's arrival at Ben's house is placed at around 2:30 AM, but the timeline provided by other witnesses suggests a different sequence of events.
We were separated, she was on heavy medication for Stage 4 lung cancer, and she was severely mentally ill. She brought up previous accusations about abuse of our children.
The fact that this wasn’t done put my children at risk.
Since we were separated, I was unaware of her state of mind.
I had let her borrow my phone.
It was returned when she passed away.
It was $5,000 out of my pocket and possibly the smoking gun on me being set up.
Her tactic of delay has the intended impact.

If they had wanted to assess the integrity of Tiffany’s statements, then they could have contacted the children.
INTRODUCTION TO CHARACTERS
Benjamin Allen – Myself
Lauren Deal -Accuser
Carmen Love is a female friend/cousin of Lauren Deal.
Spent the evening drinking with Deal at Goodfellas and Schooley’s.
James Morrison – Boyfriend of Carmen Love.
Spent the evening drinking with Deal at Goodfellas and Schooley’s.
He was with Lauren Deal on the night in question.
Peter West - Spent the evening drinking with Deal at Goodfellas and Schooley’s.
Joel Kelly – Friends with everyone involved.
Tried to blackmail me into paying Lauren 15K a year for 10 years.
He stated that he would talk to her to see if he could make this work.
Roger Hoskins – Friend of Tiffany Allen.
Tiffany kicked him out of the house when they returned to VA because he didn’t say exactly what she wanted to the police.
Jolinda Adcock – She relayed through Tiffany that it didn’t matter what happened (if I did it or not) her people at the police department assured her that I was going down.
Joseph DeMarco - He was with me that night.
Steve Happel – He was with me that night.
I also never received Lauren Deal’s medical records.
The same with the trash from my bathroom that I had bagged to save for the detectives.
The statements about where she ran were disturbing in the fact that they made no sense if she were escaping a dangerous situation.
She took a path that made no sense for someone running for their life and was fearful of everyone there.
She described an event that would be impossible to occur between two people.
If I were to have done this, then I would be a danger to the public, so why would he do that?
He had surgery scheduled for that Friday.
He also said, "Your son didn't do this, I will say a prayer for him and your family."
She stated that both counts were 9-3.
Carmen Love's statements about events at Schooly's, which were later proven false by video evidence.
For example, the report claims Carmen Love was worried and trying to contact Lauren all day, while the transcript shows Carmen admitted she forgot to text Lauren.
Given the physical layout of the area, her account of running through woods for an extended period seems implausible and should have been more thoroughly investigated.
Allen describes Lauren as "inebriated" at Schooly's bar.
He mentions Lauren throwing her keys to DeMarco and saying Allen was "responsible for her now."
Allen states Lauren was upset, calling his friends "assholes."
He describes finding Lauren face down on concrete outside Schooly's.
Allen mentions his daughter was at home, likely asleep downstairs.
Allen's account primarily describes Lauren's intoxicated behavior at the bar.
It was reported that Tiffany Allen made a lengthy recording while engaging in her hobby of ghost hunting.
When mother listened to recording, she became suspicious that Benjamin Allen had been sexually molesting the children.
Report indicated that Mother also confronted the father.
It was reported that father asked the children if he had touched them and that all the children denied except Lukas.
According to the report, Lukas had been having dreams and had called during his sleep that, “daddy peed in my mouth”.
Report indicated that Lukas was complaining that his butt hurt and Tiffany Allen took him to the children’s pediatrician.
They indicated that Tiffany Allen told them that Benjamin may have been touching them.
Lukas denied seeing his father’s penis.
Communication was difficult with Lucas as he does not speak clearly.
On that day, it was noted that the mother was behaving erratically.
She had taken children to a therapist and talked with Deb Flowers from UNC Beacon Team over the phone.
Mother took recordings to a private detective.
Social Worker Anderson listened to identified parts of the recording.
Sounds heard could possibly be sexual abuse but could also have other explanations.
On 1/30/2015, Lee County DSS received another report that indicated that Brendan Allen informed his step- mother that he has been being raped by his father since age 7.
Brendan described to Social Worker Anderson a history of sexual molestation by his father.
He said he had not told anyone about this before, but is telling now because he knows that his dad and Tiffany are going to court on 2/4/2015 and he will probably live with his dad.
He said that the abuse would then probably continue.
When social worker spoke with Lukas, and asked the child how he was doing, child spontaneously stated, “Daddy put his wiener in my mouth.
Lukas described his dad’s “wiener” as big, black and soft.
He said it happened one time.
When asked where he was when this happened, Lucas said he was in Carter’s bed and in Ben’s bed.
Lukas then would not talk further with social worker about sexual abuse.
Brendan, Carter, and Lukas disclosed sexual abuse by father/step-father, Benjamin Allen.
Social worker Anderson observed CME interviews.
Also, Brendan’s mother, Sarah Allen, described numerous incidents where Tiffany Allen talked to the children about the case, discussed the case in front of the children, and talked to the children about what they should tell social workers and Dr. Matala.
Mother indicated that kids all had parasite or bug bites.
When doctor asked the kids about their conditions, they said they had no itching or bug bites.
Mom then told them to tell the truth that they were itching all over all the time, and the kids then agreed that mom was correct.
Mom was scratching her own skin and it looked raw per the doctor.
Mom brought in a Tupperware container with what appeared to be dust in it.
Mom told the doctor to look at the bugs in the box, but there were none.
Mother told doctor to look at the bugs crawling on the child, but there were no bugs on the child.
Doctor noted that it appeared that mother had mental health issue, not substance abuse issue.
Outcome: Services not needed - Children released to family members

2/7/14—Allegations: Tiffany Allen smoking a pipe/bong outside of home and Benjamin Allen sometimes comes outside and watches her.
Marijuana smell comes from the home.
Children can be heard inside the home screaming.
A few days earlier, the four children were seen outside playing for about 20 minutes while parents were inside.
Two oldest were outside with no shoes on and two youngest were naked.
Tiffany has been seen hitting Carter about 10-13 times on various parts of his body with an open had and with a closed fist.
We were separated, she was on heavy medication for Stage 4 lung cancer, and she was severely mentally ill. She brought up previous accusations about abuse of our children.
The fact that this wasn’t done put my children at risk.
Since we were separated, I was unaware of her state of mind.
I had let her borrow my phone.
It was returned when she passed away.
It was $5,000 out of my pocket and possibly the smoking gun on me being set up.
Her tactic of delay has the intended impact.

He had surgery scheduled for that Friday.
He also said, "Your son didn't do this, I will say a prayer for him and your family."
She stated that both counts were 9-3.
She is a family member of the detective who investigated the case and is related to Lauren Deal.
James Morrison – Boyfriend of Carmen Love.
He spent the evening drinking with Deal at Goodfellas and Schooley’s.
He was with Lauren Deal on the night in question.
Peter West – He spent the evening drinking with Deal at Goodfellas and Schooley’s.
Joel Kelly – Friends with everyone involved and tried to extort me into paying Lauren 15K a year for ten years.
Roger Hoskins – Friend of Tiffany Allen.
Tiffany kicked him out of the house when they returned to VA because he didn’t say exactly what she wanted him to say to the police.
Jolinda Adcock – She relayed through Tiffany that it didn’t matter if I did it or not that I was “going down” because she had talked to her people at the sheriff’s office, who assured her I would be prosecuted and found guilty.
Friends with the Detective, accuser, wife, and hates me.
She dated my ex-wife after we were separated, and I made a comment about her not driving my children because of her drug use.
Joseph DeMarco - He was with me that night.
Steve Happel – He was with me that night.
She lost the election in 2020.
When asked why I felt that way, I responded, “If they are going to railroad me, then they don’t need me there to do it.” She went to get my attorneys.
When they walked out, they had the same questioning look.
Before they could speak, I said, ‘You heard the same thing I did.
She clearly stated that I should take the deal because “He is done.”.
This was not an acceptable response.
Once she had accomplished this, she added an aggravating factor as an additional push to force me to sign a plea deal.
The aggravating factor was that I had taken advantage of a position of trust.
To establish this, she used a single message thread from Facebook, where most of the conversation was held by someone else using my phone.
He identifies himself in the thread by name.
ADA Bartholomew willfully chose to overlook.
If anything, she proved the point that Lauren and I were not friends.
Friends would communicate far more than one message in all those years.
A single witness who saw us hanging out regularly or at all other than the night in question where she wouldn’t leave me alone?
Instead, there is a video of one night where I argued with her over inviting herself and ignored her as much as possible.
I also never received Lauren Deal’s medical records.
The same with the trash from my bathroom that I had bagged to save for the detectives.
The statements about where she ran were disturbing in the fact that they made no sense if she were escaping a dangerous situation.
She took a path that made no sense for someone running for their life and was fearful of everyone there.
She described an event that would be impossible to occur between two people.
If I were to have done this, then I would be a danger to the public, so why would he do that?
He had surgery scheduled for that Friday.
He also said, "Your son didn't do this, I will say a prayer for him and your family."
She stated that both counts were 9-3.
Affidavit Choice: Despite this, the affidavit advances a 2:00 a.m. conversation with Carmen.
Freeman Affidavit:
“They started in conversation and later after Schooly’s closed, the victim was invited to a bon fire at Ben Allen’s house with other friends.”
 "They were at Schooly's for several hours and at 2am Mrs. Deal stated she was asked by Ben and his friends if she wanted to go with them to Ben's house and have a bon fire, She agreed and told Carmen Love that she was leaving with Ben and his friends."
Haines Interview with Lauren Deal:
Deal Speaking: I was at the bar last night.
Ben was at the bar last night.
I saw him, so I ran up and hugged him because I haven't seen him in maybe over a year.
And the only reason that I know him is because the old bartender that used to work at Schoolys, her ex-husband.
So he was up there, and he had brought two of his guy friends with him, Jay and Steve and he introduced me to them.
You know they were they were all really nice.
So he asked me if I wanted to come back to his house to do a bonfire and he was going to invite some people over, so I was like, yeah of course that's fun.
Freeman Interview with Lauren Deal:
Lauren Deal: "So we all sat down started drinking.
talking just hanging out, so Carmen and James and Peter all go to leave, and they are like, come on Lauren, let's go.
And Ben looked at me, and he was like, well, I think we're going to have a bonfire at my house tonight if you want to come.
So I was like, okay, I'll do that.
And then I'll go to Carmen's, so, I told I told, Carmen that would be there later but ended up going with Ben and his friends to his house.
Testimony by Lauren Deal:
Barthlomew: "And then how long would you say you were at Schooly's?"
Lauren Deal: "Till closing, so right at 2:00.
Barthlomew: And what was the -well, who was still at Schooly's when the lights came on?"
Lauren Deal: "I mean, quite a few people, but mainly me, Ben, Jay and Steve, and then just other patrons."
So what happened to Carmen, James and Peter?"
Lauren Deal: "They left, because as the night had progressed, I had hung out with Ben and Jay and Steve quite a bit throughout the night, and Ben had mentioned that he was going to have a bonfire over at his house, and that I was, you know, more than welcome to come and hang out with them, so I decided to do that because I did not want my night to end, and so I told Carmen that I was going to go over there, and that's what happened, so she left with Peter and James."
Freeman Recorded Phone Interview With Joseph DeMarco:
“When we were at Schoolys, Ben started talking to Lauren.
Everyone is drinking, having a fun time, and then after the bar was shut down, we went back to Bens to sit by a fire."
Freeman Recorded Phone Interview With Steve Happel:
Steve Happel: Yeah, we just showed up at Schoolys.
It's kind of like, well, there was really no atmosphere.
And then that girl kind of came out of no where and started being around us and acting kind of hysterical you know we didn't give her any attention then she'd call us bunch of assholes multiple times.
I didn't give her a single reason.
Like I just did not pay attention to her and then I think she gave someone her keys cuz she was too drunk cuz she was drinking at another bar before Schoolys.
Then she had nowhere to go.
So then she came back to Ben Allen's house.
There is no mention of Carmen Love, James Morrison, or Peter West in these interviews.
These names are entirely unknown to Happel and DeMarco since they never met, regardless of what other statements may say.
Freeman Recorded Phone Call with Carmen Love:
Carmen Love: No, I mean, like she hung out with me, James, and you know Pete.
We were   all standing at the table, and she would sit there and talk to us; um, there was a, one of,   another friend there named Joseph.
I do know that she was, I mean, she talked to him.
Detective Freeman: OK. 
Carmen Love: but he was a mutual friend.
Um, I forgot about that, but he's a mutual friend.
There was a bunch of people around, you know, in there.
(She says later there weren’t many   people.)
Detective Freeman: OK. 
Carmen Love: So that I knew, but I do know that Joseph and her had a conversation, her and James did, uh, her and Pete spoke briefly, but you know.
Detective Freeman: OK. 
Carmen Love: Then I seen those two guys talking to her that I've never seen before, but that  was right when we were going to leave, and she said she wanted to stay, that she was fine, she hadn't, you know, she can drive or whatever.
(Her car wasn’t even there.)
Carmen Love: and I said, all right, let me know if you need a ride, just call me James even told her he would ride back up there with me to get her and so, but I mean, do remember like Joseph being in there, me, James, Pete, uh and honestly, I probably can't tell you any names of anyone else because there wasn't a lot of people there anyways, but there wasn't  a lot of people I knew.
Carmen's story is more aligned later on, but that is much later.
Fact Note: In addition, Carmen also doesn’t mention everyone sitting together and drinking.
She mentions the name Joseph (DeMarco) as a friend.
She had no way of knowing this name, as Carmen had left the bar before Lauren had met him.
Someone told her that name.
Evidence From Video Recording:
Fact Note: Video evidence shows that Carmen Love had already left the bar at 12:41 AM, making it impossible for the accuser to have spoken to her at 2:00 AM​.
Throughout the entire video while Love is present, there is not a single instance where these two groups meet or interact, rendering this a fabrication.
No one other than Deal said that she was invited to Ben’s house.
Deal forced her way into the group and inherently into the vehicle to get to the defendants home.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Freeman Affidavit: 
“Upon arrival they started a fire and after several minutes Mrs. Deal stated she needed to use the restroom and went inside.
She stated that she was familiar with the residence because she had been there before with his ex-wife.
When she went inside she stated that Ben walked inside with her and followed her to the bathroom.”
“Upon arrival at the house, they were sitting around the fire, The victim stated that they requested to use the restroom and was followed in the residence of 94 Beacon Circle by the owner Ben Allen.”
Officer Haines Interview:
Lauren Deal, “I told Ben I need to use the bathroom.
So he takes me inside.”
Haines Police Interview:
Lauren Deal, “Joseph and Steve started getting firewood to put onto the fire, and I looked at Ben and I told him that I had to pee, so he walked me inside.”
Freeman Police Interview:
Deal Speaking: "It was it was no later than 245, so I walked inside, and I've been in this house before because I've been in there with Tiffany.
So I knew where everything was, and he told me to use the restroom in his room.
So like, when you walk into his room, it's his room, and then his bathroom is back there.
So I walked back there, and he followed me into the bathroom and stood in the doorway, and I was like, you know, I said get out.
I have to pee, he's like, no, I'm gonna stand here.”

Freeman Phone Interview with Joseph DeMarco:
DeMarco, ”We were collecting firewood getting a fire going again.
Lauren and Ben then went inside.”
Happel, “So then she came back to Ben Allen's house.
I woke up, I was just about to call the police, and then I get afraid and leave.
Then, when I leave, I'm driving down the road near Route 1, and I see her running through a field."
Fact Note: DeMarco never said he searched for her.
“They were at Schooly's for several hours and at 2am Mrs. Deal stated she was asked by Ben and his friends if she wanted to go with them to Ben's house to have a bonfire.
She agreed and told Carmen Love that she was leaving with Ben and his friends."
Carmen Love can be seen exiting the bar with James Morrison at 12:41:25.
This occurred before Lauren Deal had approached or spoken to anyone in the group.
Deal Speaking: “I told him to get out because I had to pee and he stood in the doorway and he told me that he was going to watch me.
So I still pulled my pants down because I had to pee and I was like just please get out.
I have to pee”
Freeman affidavit: "In the bedroom he held her down on the bed with her arms above her head and then pulled her pants down."
I woke up I was I was just about to call the police and then you know I get I get afraid and I leave and then when I leave, I'm driving down the road near Route 1 and I see her running through a field."
Lauren says that he found her and she hid behind a tree and DeMarco says field.
Then there is the fact that the direction DeMarco would have driven would have taken him the opposite direction of Sanford making it very unlikely he would have encountered Lauren if she had actually ran.
She didn't run ten miles or two or even a tenth of a mile.
She even made up commentary she "heard" when they were looking for her. "
Freeman affidavit: "Mr. Happle stated that his friends Joseph Demarco and Ben Allen went to Schooly's and while they were there they met up with Lauren."
It's kind of like well there was really no atmosphere.
And then that girl kind of came out of no where and started being around us and acting kind of hysterical you know we didn't give her any attention then she'd call us bunch of assholes multiple times.
And which I don't know I didn't give her a single reason.
Like I just did not pay attention to her and then I think she gave someone her keys cuz she was too drunk cuz she was drinking at another bar before Schoolys.
Then she had nowhere to go.
So then she came back to Ben Allen's house.” 
He also testified to the same.
Freeman affidavit: "After sometime Mrs. Love stated that they were going to leave and asked if Lauren needed a ride.
Lauren declined and stated she was going to go hangout with the guys and go to a bon fire.
Mrs. Love told her to call her later and that she could come pick her up.
Mrs. Love stated that she became worried because she had been attempting to contact her all day."
Carmen Love's actual statement to Freeman ---Carmen Love: "No.
You know, earlier, I was laying there, we were laying in the bed watching TV, and I thought I need to text her to see if she's okay, and I checked my message messenger, and then Chloe called, and it just slipped my mind."
Carmen Love did not express any concern about Lauren.
Freeman affidavit: "Upon getting to the house they started to build a fire and he walked inside the house behind Lauren while she went to the bathroom.
Mr. Allen stated that he then went to his bedroom.
A short time later he heard noises and heard Lauren screaming in the woods and that he noticed Demarco and Steve talking to her."
Reality from Recorded Interview:
DeMarco, "We were collecting firewood, getting a fire going again.
Lauren and Ben then went inside."
Reality from Recorded Interview:
DeMarco, " I was like..
I woke up I was I was just about to call the police and then you know I get I get afraid and I leave and then when I leave, I'm driving down the road near Route 1 and I see her running through a field."
Lauren said DeMarco found her hiding behind a tree.
Lauren also noted that it was pitch black outside and she couldn’t see her hand in front of her face, in an attempt to make the sequence of events more dramatic.
All of these things can’t be true.
Freeman Interview:
Lauren Deal: "So we all sat down started drinking.
talking just hanging out, so Carmen and James and Peter all go to leave, and they are like, come on Lauren, let's go.
And Ben looked at me, and he was like, well, I think we're going to have a bonfire at my house tonight if you want to come.
So I was like, okay, I'll do that.
And then I'll go to Carmen's, so, I told I told, Carmen that would be there later ended up going with Ben and his friends to his house.
Steve Freeman: Yes, he told me that the victim in this case, Lauren Deal, she was actually at -- she was out with some friends.
They were at Goodfellas, then proceeded to go over to Schooly's.
Once they were at Schooly's, they went from Goodfellas to Schooly's.
She was with her friends Carmen Love and her boyfriend James.
And once they got to Schooly's, they met up with the defendant, Benjamin Allen, and a couple of his friends, Joe DeMarco and Steve Happel.
(From Officer Haines Report: SHE WENT TO SCHOOLY'S BAR WITH HER COUSIN CARMEN LOVE, AND WHILE THERE, MET BEN ALLEN, AND HIS FRIENDS JOSEPH DEMARCO AND A SUBJECT WITH THE FIRST NAME OF STEVE.
SHE STATED THEY ALL DRANK TOGETHER, UNTIL 02:00 HRS, WITH CARMEN LOVE LEAVING THE BAR AT SOME POINT PRIOR DURING THE NIGHT, -------There is no mention of James Morrison or Peter West in the report from Officer Haines.)
LAUREN DEAL: So I was gonna stay with Carmen, which is my friend and cousin Carmen 
FREEMAN: Carmen who?
FREEMAN: "Alright So, we'll stay with Carmen Love.
LAUREN DEAL: "Okay," 
FREEMAN: "Do you know her address?"
LAUREN DEAL: "No, she just moved in with her boyfriend today.
I don't know her address, and I would give you her phone number, but I don't have my phone back.
So we said we were going to ride to Schoolys and go over there.
LAUREN DEAL: Me, her boyfriend, and her with Peter, her boyfriend, James Morrison and Peter West, and me, I got the four of us that went together."
James, what you know his name?"
LAUREN DEAL: "No I don't and then Peter West and then me," Officer Speaking: "Okay.
LAUREN DEAL: "So I see him.
I give him a hug, I haven't seen him in maybe a year, so I gave him a hug.
We talked as, and I was, he asked me how it was, you know, the normal conversation and then he said that he had brought two of his guy friends with him which was Joseph and Steve."
Haines Interview
Deal Speaking ----- I have bruises on my arms from being held down.
They took pictures of them at the hospital.

A: That's what she stated.
Q: And you were not here when she said that that bruise may have come from falling in the woods, correct?
Q: But she maintained to you that she had bruises from being held down, correct?
Q: And that would have been around the wrist, correct?
A: That's what she implied.
A: Right here, like my neck, clavicle area.
And did you have any injury to that area?
A: Some cuts, some looks like bruises forming already.
And do you know how you got those cuts and bruises?
A: Yeah, in the woods, falling, being pushed.
MS. BARTHOLOMEW: Your honor, if I may approach the witness?
Q: You are just going to have to keep your voice up just
A: little bit.
Q: And did you have any do you know if that's your left arm or your right arm?
Did you have any injury to your left arm?

LAUREN DEAL: We were really good friends.
I mean, I would go to her house.
MS. BARTHOLOMEW: You stated that you had been to Tiffany's house before.
LAUREN DEAL: They were off and on.
Were they living in the same residence?
And how many times would you just estimate that you had gone over to that house?
MS. BARTHOLOMEW: What would you do when you would go there?
LAUREN DEAL: We grilled out.
We would sit around and talk, just hang out.
MS. BARTHOLOMEW: And you said that you both had met each other's kids.
How many kids did Tiffany have?
LAUREN DEAL: The only two that I met were the two -- I mean, I don't want to say their name because I don't know if that's allowed or not.
MS. BARTHOLOMEW: If you know their names, you can say them.
LAUREN DEAL: Morgan and Lucas were the two that I met

Lauren claims to be really close to Tiffany.
They both tried to play this up but the facts are she didn’t even know if Tiffany was married or not?
Interview with Officer Haines:
Deal Speaking: " I'd known him previous to this because of his ex-wife."
Deal Speaking: "I knew who he was; I'd hung out with him with his ex-wife before.
Do you know, have you known Ben before this?
Deal Speaking: "His ex-wife used to work as the bartender at Schoolys?
Which is how I knew him.”
Interview with Officer Haines:
Officer Haines ----- Have you ever been to that house before?
Deal Speaking ----- I have been there before with Tiffany.
Before they were separated, me and I went over there and cooked dinner for her and her kids.
She has cancer and she lives with her mom in West Virginia now.
I haven't seen her in a while.
Fact Note: She lived with two parents in Virginia.
The word from Tiffanys sisters and Morgan is that they talked everyday after this happened and not before.
That is why she got the state wrong.
This is also why she got the number of kids wrong also.
Tiffany lost custody of a child and she caused the defendant to lose custody of his child but their pictures are all over the walls in the house.
If she only knew about two children then she must not really have been in the house.
When they were separated Tiffany lived in the house under the water tower by the courthouse.
There was not pictures of the kids at that house.
LAUREN DEAL: You walk up the stairs into the front door.
There is a living room that you walk into.
Their bedroom door -- the living room is here, and the bedroom door is here.
There is a bannister around the stairs.
There is a bathroom behind the bannister of the stairs.
To the right, there is a kitchen, and then beside of that is a dining room.
When you go downstairs, there is some bedrooms, and then at the very end of the hallway is a bathroom.
MS. BARTHOLOMEW: Now, had you ever spent the night at that residence?
LAUREN DEAL: Yes, in the downstairs bedroom.
MS. BARTHOLOMEW: Ever use the bathroom in that residence before?
LAUREN DEAL: Yes, in the downstairs and the guest bathroom upstairs.
Fact Notes: It is like she saw pictures online and didn’t know what she was looking at.
She doesn’t mention the largest room in the house.
At the end of the hallway is a massive family room with another bathroom.
She also missed a bedroom upstairs right by the bathroom.
He had to be told because he wasn’t there when she was and after that she wasn’t allowed.
MS. BARTHOLOMEW: And did you ever communicate with the defendant through Facebook?
MS. BARTHOLOMEW:  Your honor, if I may approach the witness?
LAUREN DEAL: Messages between me and Ben.
And do you know who, or how did -- when you were contacting him or he was contacting you through Facebook, how would that work?
Would that be on the laptop, a cell phone or something else?
LAUREN DEAL: My cell phone.
And did you -- were you able to retrieve any messages that you had between yourself and Mr. Allen using Facebook?
LAUREN DEAL: Facebook Messenger, yes.
MS. BARTHOLOMEW: So Facebook Messenger, is that an application that allows you to send direct messages to the person?
LAUREN DEAL: I gave them to you.
MR. WUNSCH:  Well, in this message, it clearly states -- I mean, she is picking out part of it, but in this message, it clearly states that this is not Ben.
And the last message states later that Ben says, I wasn't even -- I didn't even have possession of my phone.
It's clearly in the text it's not Ben.
Just know that we have a screenshot of a Facebook message.
My real problem, though, your honor, is that we -- it's identified as another person conducting the message, and at the very end, Ben comes on, identified himself, saying, I didn't have my phone.
Screenshots from Facebook.
It is a screenshot which this witness indicated came from her phone.
Says "Ben Allen" and has a date, December 3, 2016, 1:49 p.m.
It references a discussion that they purportedly had about a bonfire.
If she testifies that they had a discussion prior to December 3, 2016, at 1:49, then that would give this particular page context.
It is true that the balance of the pages beginning on page two suggest that there is now another individual using his phone, but that occurs sometime later in the evening at 7:42 p.m.
There is no reason to believe that it is not Ben Allen, particularly if he is referring to a conversation that happened earlier about a bonfire.
You can bring them back in.
LAUREN DEAL: December 3, 2016.
LAUREN DEAL: 1:49 p.m.
MS. BARTHOLOMEW: And who sent that first message in State's Exhibit number four?
LAUREN DEAL: Remember when I said I was having that bonfire on the 10th?
MS. BARTHOLOMEW: And did you ever reply to that message?
LAUREN DEAL: Yes, like three hours later.
LAUREN DEAL: I don't have a babysitter.
MS. BARTHOLOMEW: And then was there any conversation after that?
LAUREN DEAL: He said, dang, then sent a picture of the bonfire, and then I said, yeah, I know.
MS. BARTHOLOMEW: And you earlier stated that you guys had bonfires.
What Bartholomew actually got from Deal:
Identification of the screenshot/date/time and that the first 1:49 p.m. message shows “Ben” saying: “Remember when I said I was having that bonfire on the 10th?
It is tonight.”
Deal’s reply timing and content (4:39 p.m., “I don’t have a babysitter”), and brief follow-ups.
Bartholomew did not elicit an explicit statement from Deal that an earlier conversation actually occurred (e.g., “Yes, we discussed it earlier that day/earlier in the week”).
In the excerpt, there is no direct Q/A: “Did you and Ben talk about a bonfire before 1:49 that day?” “Yes.” → Absent.
This is what ADA Bartholomew spent her time on instead of trying to find truth:
ADA: How did you get to UNC?
ADA: And other than yourself and your mom, was anybody else in the vehicle?
ADA: So you had mentioned that Mr. DeMarco and his girlfriend had come to CCH.
Deal: Maybe ten minutes before we left.
Deal: They were not I mean, they stayed she got there to give me pants, but I mean, after that, they didn't stay because they knew they couldn't go to the hospital, and I think what happened kind of shook them up quite a bit.
Deal: I feel like he was just as scared as I was.
I mean, you know, in the car ride to the hospital, you know, he had said that he would not let anything else happen to me.
He would not take me back over there.
His girlfriend had been through something similar, and his exact words were, my girlfriend would kill me if I didn't help you.
Too Neat in the Emotional Arc
She moves seamlessly from:
A fact-like statement (“they knew they couldn’t go to the hospital”)
To a dramatic perception (“he was just as scared as I was”)
To an exact, cinematic quote (“my girlfriend would kill me if I didn’t help you”)
That progression is tidy in a way spontaneous recollection usually isn’t — especially under courtroom questioning.
It feels constructed to hit emotional beats.
Ironically, when a witness recalls an exact turn of phrase from a casual conversation during a traumatic moment — especially years later — it often suggests story reinforcement over time, rather than raw memory.
She lacks the self-perception to realize the abomination she has become.
Tiffany “Nifong” Bartholomew doesn’t deserve to be a public servant.
I was going to attach it to this email.
I was out the following day.
None of it made sense, so I went back over the timeline.
They showed a video in court of Lauren arriving at the hospital to meet her mother.
Freddie objected to the video, but it was still allowed.
I want to know where and when he got this video.
I was under the impression that he showed up at the hospital that night.
In his arrest warrant he wrote “Upon arriving at Central Carolina Hospital, her mother recorded her arrival along with Joseph Demarco.” I am pretty sure he showed up at the hospital that night after Carmen called him.
When Lauren's mother was questioned about the hospital, she was asked if she gave the video to anyone.
She said she gave it to Freeman that night.
He then got off shift, went to his brother's wedding, and then pretended that he got called about some rape.
Not only is what Lauren described in the house physiologically impossible, but the time doesn't fit either.
She wasn't out stumbling through the woods.
Neither of those things could have possibly happened.
She couldn't have done all three.
No one there can reasonably tell how long she was in the house.
She used the bathroom, walked out, asked if I wanted a drink of water, then left the room.
That is precisely what happened.
I didn't notice that she didn't have pants on because I HAD NO INTEREST IN HER WHATSOEVER.
I was trying to lie down to sleep.
She said she did not remember if the door was locked.
Freeman kept saying that I followed her into the house: ("The victim stated that they requested to use the restroom and was followed in the residence of 94 Beacon Circle by the owner Ben Allen.
")She didn't say that in either of her interviews.
She said I took her inside.
I made sure the door was locked every time I left the house.
I confirmed with Morgan that the door was locked before I left this time.
So, how did she get out of the truck and walk into the house?
How was it possible that she opened the door and I followed her?
She didn't just walk into the house .
He knows that her story is trash.
There is no other answer to how dumb this shit is, and he still arrested me.
Made sure Morgan checked it before I left.
Freeman kept saying I followed her.
He didn’t even remember me arriving and calling him again looking for a place to park because he doesn’t write anything down.
I called him because I didn't see a place to park.
We talked briefly and I ended up parking on the road.
When I got off the phone I told him I was on my way  in.
Why wasn't this call recorded?
He was still in the office.
I asked if it would be quick because I had to get back to Morgan.
I was asking to many questions, so he took me to his office where THERE ARE NO CAMERAS.
I texted Tiffany and Happel.
He came back and booked me into the jail.
This interview tipped me off, as they knew each other somehow.
The conversation was so familiar.
I didn't know they were having family Christmas parties but it didn’t sound right.
It wasn't just the tone or the fact that it seemed somewhat rehearsed.
Carmen mentioned Chloe, and he knew who it was without asking for a last name or any amplifying information.
He did the same thing with Tiffany when she mentioned Jolinda.
He knew precisely who Jolinda was when she said it.
When I heard that, I was like, a.)
How does he know Jolinda b.)
How does Tiffany know that he would know who Jolinda was if she mentioned it?
I had to look up her last name again while writing that down - Adcock.
Do you know why I had to look up her name again?
I thought for the longest time that Tiffany was just talking because she is Tiffany.
It made sense when I later found out Jolinda actually does have contacts at the Sheriff's office.
The back story between us is that Jolinda and I got into an argument when she was dating my ex-wife and asked to drive my kids.
She always nodded out on "zanibars" and had just wrecked her truck.
She seemed not to have to worry about driving under the influence.
Tiffany told Freeman that I wanted Tiffany to call and ask Jolinda for help.
Tiffany doesn't think through her lies at all.
Why would I ask someone who hates me for help?
Why would I even assume Jolinda would know someone at the Sheriff's office?
I thought she was a junky, Why would a junkie have contacts at the police department?
Regardless, Carmen lied to him also.
I think Carmen has some issues.
In the first phone interview she said she knew Joseph.
Someone told her to say that.
She didn’t even know what any of us looked like.
Carmen Love was interviewed on two separate occasions.
Haines indicated that Deal had spent the evening of October 18 at Goodfellas and Schooly's bars with friends Carmen Love and James, where they later encountered Benjamin Allen (the defendant), Joe DeMarco, and Steve Happel.
He then retrieved video footage from Deal’s mother showing Deal arriving at Central Carolina Hospital (CCH) early on October 19.
Allen described their interactions, mentioning she hugged him, and that Deal was “rubbing up on his neck.” Freeman noted that Allen denied engaging in any sexual contact beyond hugging and kissing​.
His statement detailed an interaction he witnessed between Tiffany Allen and Benjamin Allen, in which Allen reportedly mentioned concerns that Deal's allegations would ruin his life​.
On the porch, they observed items, including Deal’s sandals, keys, wallet, and ID.
Deal was seen consuming multiple drinks.
“Release me” implies he felt his freedom was already restricted, physically or by implication.
"They are charging you / Yup.
He observed Deal consuming alcohol and recorded her interactions with Allen, which he described as “friendly.”
Freeman’s analysis of the footage was used to corroborate Deal’s account of the evening, though his subjective interpretation of the interactions as “friendly” rather than potentially concerning or predatory could be scrutinized.
Lauren Deal said that she ran up and hugged Mr. Allen when she saw him.
The only hug was after Mr. Allen became upset because she invited herself to his house and didn't leave with her friends.
The hug WAS NOT returned and Mr. Allen backed away.
Freeman's affidavit said that Lauren went inside the bar and started talking to Mr. Allen Lauren's interview she states that she ran up and gave him a hug and they sat around talking.
Lauren Deal states in her interview with police that everyone sat down and started drinking to include Carmen, James and Peter.
She says that Mr. Allen looks at her and ask her to stay.
The video shows that Peter West leaves and then later Carmen Love and James Morrison leave and Lauren hasn't even talked to anyone yet.
Lauren Deal testified that she threw her keys to Mr. Allen.
The video shows Mr. Allen refusing her keys and her giving them to DeMarco after Mr. Allen says that he isnt' going to be responsible for her since he has his own DD.
She takes her keys to DeMarco and teh video clearly shows her giving her keys to DeMarco.
She said that she gave them to Mr. Allen because she trusted him to make sure nothing happened to her.
Lauren describes herself as being tipsy, feeling good, giggling, laughing.
She is seen multiple times yelling at Mr. Allen, walking around the bar with no shoes and bouncing drunkenly off of stools at the bar.
Lauren testifies to leaving with Ben, Joseph, and Steve and knowing they would be in Ben's truck since Ben made the comment that DeMarco would be driving.
Lauren Deal left the bar by herself.
This conversation could not have happened.
Freeman put in his affidavit that they were all talking at schoolies for several hours till 2am before Ben and his friends asked Lauren to come back with them to have a bonfire and she told Carmen that she was leaving with Ben and his friends.
Carmen was not even at the bar at 2am.
She had left over an hour earlier.
The video, however, shows this did not happen—there was no initial hug, and the one hug that did occur was brief, unreciprocated, and happened later after Allen became upset.
Presence of Friends: Deal described sitting and drinking with her friends, including Carmen, James, and Peter, and alleged that Allen asked her to stay.
However, the video shows that her friends left the bar before she even engaged in significant conversation, and Peter left early.
This contradicts her account and demonstrates a misrepresentation of her interactions that night.
Handling of Keys: Deal testified that she threw her keys to Allen, stating she trusted him to ensure her safety.
The video, however, shows Allen refusing the keys, with Deal eventually handing them to DeMarco after Allen explicitly stated he was not responsible for her.
Other Discrepancies:
Deal’s Demeanor and Actions: Deal described herself as tipsy, giggling, and laughing, yet the video shows her as visibly intoxicated—yelling, walking around barefoot, and stumbling.
This discrepancy between her self-reported behavior and what is actually seen on video further challenges her reliability.
Departure from the Bar: Deal testified that she left with Allen, DeMarco, and Happel, and was aware they’d be traveling in Allen’s truck with DeMarco driving.
However, the video shows she left alone, making it impossible for any conversation about a designated driver in Allen’s truck to have taken place.
The video disproves this: Carmen had left over an hour earlier, and no such extended interaction occurred.
ADA Bartholomew: And were those black pants ever sent off to the state crime laboratory?
ADA Bartholomew: And why was that?
Lauren Deal and Detective Freeman have the same count of beers but let themselves be off by one on the shots.
Lauren Deal said he was the drunkest that night.
The video shows that he drank the least out of everyone.
The video showed that she gave them to DeMarco.
“Trust/Confidence” Rebutted by Objective Record
Video shows Mr. Allen avoiding Ms. Deal (even refusing a hug); the witness conceded the closer friendship was with the ex-wife; there was a multi-year gap in contact.
Been balls deep in this case.
I think I am getting some good stuff together.
Then my sister’s leg is still jacked so mom is up there with her so I run by dads a bit to help him out.
You know how unrganized I am ?
Carmen Love was interviewed on two separate occasions.
*Notes on Peter West and James Morrison
Peter West's Identity and Background
Peter West was with Lauren Deal's group at Goodfellas and Schooly's bar on the night in question.
Peter West has relationships with William Sturkie and Brian Estes.
Carmen Love was not present either, but she was interviewed.
James Morrison’s Identity and Background
James Morrison was Carmen Love's boyfriend at the time of the incident.
James Morrison's brother also worked for the city before he passed away.
Freeman and James Morrison were described as "close and go to family gatherings together."
Carmen Love was not present either, but she was interviewed.
Significance to the Case
They were with Lauren Deal at Goodfellas and Schooly's bar on the night in question.
Could have provided critical first-hand testimony about Lauren Deal's level of intoxication and behavior.
He interviewed Carmen Love, who was with Lauren for the same duration as James Morrison.
Carmen presented a rehearsed story with emotive language.
Timeline of Key Events
Date of Incident, Oct 2019: Alleged events at Goodfellas and Schooly's bar involving Lauren Deal, Benjamin Allen, and others (e.g., Joseph DeMarco, Steve Happel).
The video shows Deal's interactions after 12:45 AM; Carmen Love left at 12:40 AM.
West background from original.
Morrison ties from original.
I also never received Lauren Deal’s medical records.
The same with the trash from my bathroom that I had bagged to save for the detectives.
The statements about where she ran were disturbing in the fact that they made no sense if she were escaping a dangerous situation.
She took a path that made no sense for someone running for their life and was fearful of everyone there.
She described an event that would be impossible to occur between two people.
If I were to have done this, then I would be a danger to the public, so why would he do that?
He had surgery scheduled for that Friday.
He also said, "Your son didn't do this, I will say a prayer for him and your family."
She stated that both counts were 9-3.
Our sustainable belief That deconstructing The story that she told Would Very easy.
The notable absence of Miss Carmen.
The wild story That she proposed happening In her Phone interview with the private investigator.
She would have been a prom Witness To show the conspiracy.
This would Greatly increase the aperture Of which What questions could have been asked, And again, being able to deconstruct the story That they put together to all tell the same Whatever.
He swiped these away In moments.
One of the key points that I keep coming back to Is when he entered the bedroom Were Miss Lauren, Dio had reported this event, had occurred, 

Attorney Crews.
Ask him About the processes that he employed within that room.
The only response repeatedly that was given Was he took pictures.
Here's why this Part is so critical.
This story has many Unique actors.
Regardless of what La she has to tell A person she has to betray Or child.
She has to hurt Her single Madness.
And focus, I'm getting what she wants.
And at the minimum to be handed that material, it was offered by Miss Allen.
As we can tell from the interaction between Miss Allen on her first phone call with detective Freeman, When Miss Alan Menson mentioned someone named jolinda.
Who this Jolinda is Wong Salon thought it important to bring to Linda up to detective Freeman.
Never ask, Who the student person was.
We still don't understand.
Relationship between these parties involved.
That her friends at the police department Would take care of it.
I do want to know How he knows Jo Linda For the record.
Miss Tiffany Allen had dated Miss Jelinda Adcock During Their marital separation.
Mr. Allen became aware of the fact that Joe Linda had wrecked her vehicle.
Under the influence Of something called zany bars.
God behavior of her, passing out and drooling onto the bar Led to her also driving a vehicle In the same state Once Mr. Allen learned of this.
That this was a severe addiction That would possibly lead Turn.
His only hope Was to exclude his children From a possible negative outcome By writing in the vehicle with someone Who was struggling with addiction On something that's powerful.
As these zany bars, He had seen the effects Of these On Mr. Linda himself.
He had witnessed her Laid out on the bar, Passed out.
Groggy Not herself, Not someone It would be aware And caring While his children Or passengers in her vehicle.
This apparently Created a rift That was unrepairable.
A rift That must have been so bad.
That Joe Linda involved herself.
Because Dur Tiffany, Allen's Outburst And in anger, she stated That she had talked to jolinda And it didn't matter.
Even after hearing this come out of Tiffany's mouth Mr. Allen Steele With somewhat in a state of disbelief because Miss Allen says, a lot of things that aren't true.
It is weighed By those relationships that you've built over a lifetime of growing up in a small town.
We can all see the advantage Of doing a favor for a friend Of helping someone out Of being someone there for someone in their time of need.
A single father Whose children have lost her mother.
One's Community Should be healed.
Miss Lauren deal Didn't need help.
It wasn't a sexual assault kit that she needed.
It was mental health support that she required.
We heard about her past experiences in school and how she was picked on and Had to find another way in which to move through that environment.
We know about the mental health medications that she's on now.
Those medications are what she Should never been drinking on in the first place.
But she made a decision that night.
Is our belief that Once she found herself in that position And Mr. Ellen not willing to participate.
It wasn't just Anger That came across her.
What if a friend Tiffany Found out?
She saw that Mr. Allen was not interested In her.
So, why would he not bring this up the following day To his wife, his ex-wife?
The anger may have been bearable, But the embarrassment Was not.
All those times that she was made fun of came back again.
And now I can see herself.
She was teased were true Because in her mind She was to climb in that bed with Ms Rowell.
And when he refused any advance on her part at all.
The only thing she had Was a realization That she's a fucking piece of shit.

Tiffany was caught with marijuana in her system when she was in the hospital.
Since it wasn’t in Lukas’s meconium she wasn’t charged.
She said she had just smoked with her mom before coming to the hospital.
She promised that she would stop and never smoke again.
It was too much on the family, she was sorry, she would do whatever it took.
NOV 29 – DEC 7 2010 – This was Tiffany’s first breakdown.
She has Brendan that he had bugs coming out of his nose when she took them to the hospital.
I heard all this from my sister who was with her during her visits to the doctors.
DEC 20, 2012 – JAN 4, 2011 – I came home from Afghanistan due to Tiffany’s breakdown.
She was very stressed at first but said she was ok.  She was happy that I was home.
She got better quickly and her mood improved.
She seemed to be doing much better once I got home.
We discussed how she could take advantage of her support system and keep her sister from making her life a nightmare.
Her sister would drop her kids off (at least 5) and disappear.
This situation made it worse on my children and Tiffany.
I was ready to get away from her sister and her family.
They were terrible to be around.
Very bad influences for the kids.
Tiffany was travelling back and forth for a while getting stuff from the house in McDaniels.
She had an accident one day that broke her shoulder.
This wasn’t the worst part.
Morgan was playing in the back.
She wasn’t in her seatbelt.
Tiffany said that she “wouldn’t” get in her seatbelt.
She was afraid that she was badly injured or dead after the accident.
She said Morgan ended up in the very back of the van.
I had asked her to not make the trips many times before this accident.
I said that we would do them together and make it a time that we could see my parents.
I am not sure why she kept going back and forth or why she wouldn’t at least make Morgan get in her seatbelt.
FEB 15, 2013 – FEB 28, 2013 – Kelly Patrick (Tiffany’s sister’s boyfriend) told me that I was living with the craziest sister in the family and how did it feel to live with someone who had lied to me for years.
I asked what he was talking about.
He said she had never quit smoking marijuana.
She went to great lengths to hide it but never stopped.
I confronted her when I saw a text message on her phone saying someone was there for her pickup.
She said she was sorry and would go to rehab.
She called her dad and they researched it.
She said it was 30k for her stay.
We then talked about her going to the doctor and getting medication to help with her emotions.
She said she needed marijuana to make the feelings / visions of her abuse as a child go away.
I sympathized with this so I tried working with her instead of losing my family over addiction.
FEB – JUNE 2013– We continued to fight over her breach of trust in our relationship of her continual reliance on marijuana.
She did get various medications but didn’t stay on them long citing various side effects.
July 2013 – Tiffany creates a dating profile on Zoosk.
I didn’t know how she didn’t think I would see it.
We regularly used each other’s accounts.
She had to log into mine to check on the bills or get information and vice versa.
I just wanted to see if she would ever tell me about it.
I never mentioned it but asked her numerous times if there was anything that she wanted to tell me.
I even brought her into the room when there was a special on 20/20 about today’s dating sites.
She asked what I was doing watching it and them accused me of having a dating profile.
NOV 22, 2013 – Tiffany sends me videos and notes about her fight with Carter.
She said that she was having problems with him and the other kids.
She said that they weren’t listening to Corey either – when she left him to babysit for her.
She talked about going to clubs with her friend, etc.
This led to putting a lot of stress on Corey to the point he was ready to move to his father’s.
(I have the emails where she discussed this topic.)
NOV 27, 2013 – Tiffany commits Carter to a place in KY for a week.
They usually don’t accept kids that young but he told them that he wished demons would come and take his mommy to hell.
After they observe Carter they relay to Tiffany that it isn’t him.
They tell her it is her parenting.
She is upset when she tells me this and I hear again about how she is going to change.
I am with the kids at Chucky Cheese.
Tiffany calls and then the phone is taken from her from a police officer.
I let him know that I will be on my way but that I am in Bowling Green.
He wasn’t there when I arrived but I did talk with the Social Worker and she spoke with the kids.
Tiffany’s friend (Jenna) visits to see Tiffany and bring her a fix.
Tiff hadn’t met Lorrie Cotton to provide her with her drugs.
She met Lorrie during football practice for Brendan and somehow struck that conversation up…
May 30, 2014 – Tiffany had me take a polygraph test.
A week before Tiffany called me while I was at Tractor Supply picking up things for the house to say “I caught you mo**er f*cker.
I have you on recording f*cking my friend.”  I didn’t know what to say so I just said that I have to go.
I talk with her once I get home and ask for the recording so I can listen to it.
I sit in my car to listen to the recording.
Carter jumps in and says “What’s up dad.”  I let him know that I am just trying to hear something on the phone.
I asked Carter who that sounds like.
He says “That’s momma.”  I get out to the car so I can talk with her.
It is obvious that it isn’t me, Jenna or anyone else besides her but that isn’t enough.
She had me take a polygraph test.
I thought that we could finally begin to work on her mental state if I did this for her.
I thought this would be a defining way to get her to face her issues.
I didn’t understand her explanation of the events or how it is was supposed to have happened.
I was outside with the kids the night she said that I supposedly did slept with Jenna.
I had set up a table, speakers, projector, and screen so we could watch movies outside.
It was nice outside so we brought out pillows, covers, popcorn, etc.
Everyone was outside at first but then Tiffany, Jenna and Jenna’s boyfriend went inside.
The kids and I came in later after the movies were over.
I put the kids to bed and then went to bed with Tiffany.
She accused me waking Jenna up and having sex with her.
Sometime in June 2014 – Her mother and I talk to her about getting help.
I had sent many resources while I was in AFG but she ignored them all.
Her mother helped me talk with her about going to see someone.
She finally agreed with the caveat that there was nothing wrong with her and it was all me.
I told her that I would go also when she wanted.
Summer into Fall 2014 – She was doing good in therapy.
She asked me to help her put her thoughts together so she could talk to the therapist about her past.
I said I would but she never wanted to sit down to do it.
She told me her therapist had told her that it was important that she had such strong support at home.
I told her to just let me know and I would help out anyway that I could.
Her therapist had to have surgery.
Things went downhill for us pretty quickly.
She was convinced that I was down there with a woman.
She called the hotel and they said that “we” had already checked out.
He had checked out early because he had to go to Liberia for the Ebola outbreak.
She was convinced that this was a women and I was cheating on her.
NOV 10 – NOV 21, 2014 – I sent Tiffany links about the impacts of marijuana on someone who has mental help issues.
She said she never read them.
She was talking about a friend of hers that was getting cheated on by her husband and was asking me how she could report it to his work.
He works for the CIA so I told her to report it to the Inspector General.
She told me how he and her girlfriend was breaking into Amy’s Facebook account, stalking her, and making threats.
I even talked to Amy on the phone to encourage her to let her know it would be ok.
I think this was all a ploy to distract me and get information about how she could report me for cheating on her.
I didn’t think about his until later.
They asked all kinds of questions, talked about how Amy used devices around the house to spy on him, how bad he treated her, all kinds of stuff that still just seems like WAY too similar to be a coincidence.
Mid November 2015 – I got a call at when I left work with Tiffany screaming.
She said Lukas was hurt bad and Morgan also.
I asked what happened but she just said, “I hate you!
This is all your fault!” she then hung up on me.
I tried to call a couple of times.
She answered once and said something about Lukas’s eye.
I got home and went to see the kids.
They were pretty scuffed up but seemed ok.  Lukas had road rash on his face, arm and leg.
Morgan was scraped up on her leg and said her crotch hurt.
I immediately put them in my car and Tiff and I went to the Emergicare in Sanford by the PapaJohn’s.
They checked out and the doctor said they looked ok.
I asked Tiffany what had happened when I had gotten home.
She said Morgan had kept bugging her about riding the go-cart and she was trying to talk on the phone so she couldn’t deal with it.
She said she got tired of hearing it so she said that she could ride it with Lukas.
I couldn’t believe what I was hearing.
She said it was my fault since I had bought it for them…  Morgan was asking because no one was supposed to be on it unless one of us was outside.
Everyone knew this…that is why she asked.
All Tiffany had to do was go outside with her and show her the area they were restricted to riding since Brendan and Carter had their accident.
They were only allowed to ride in a circle in the front yard.
Morgan was asking – following the rules.
I don’t understand why Tiff let her ride it or how it became my fault when I wasn’t even home.
NOV 30th 2014– Tiffany’s parents were in for Thanksgiving.
When I got up Tiffany and her mother were sitting at the table.
I asked where Dan (her step-father) was at.
She said that he was out getting the RV ready for their trip.
I went outside to assist if I could.
Everything seemed a little different but no one was saying much.
I just assumed it was because they were leaving after staying the week of Thanksgiving.
The kids were getting in the RV.
Tiff said that they were going to ride down the road with her parents and that she would pick them up.
I said that she could ride with them also and I would come get them instead of her driving separate.
I could stay and she would go get them.
She didn’t come back for hours.
I texted her a couple of times when it started to get late.
She responded with something and she came home a while later.
This is when she announced to me that she had listened to recordings with her mother and father that contained “proof” that I was abusing the children.
She said that Dan didn’t believe it but he couldn’t wait to get out of there.
The morning started making a little more sense.
She said that she had spent the day at the Sherriff’s office with a detective and the FBI.
She said that she had turned over recordings, my computer, etc.
We argued for a few minutes.
I finally gave up trying to talk to her.
I said that whatever she was going through that I would help her through it.
At this point I went into the living room to get away from the situation.
She came in crying saying she was sorry and didn’t know why I loved her so much.
I let her lay there but told her that I didn’t really feel like touching her.
We ended up going to bed together about an hour later.
She laid down in bed with me and we tried to sleep.
The kids were getting up from bed so I just asked them all to grab their stuff so they could come in the room with us.
They had heard us arguing earlier and she had accused me of abuse so I thought that it would be good if we all slept in the room together.
She got up the next morning and flipped out about all the kids being in the room.
I didn’t get this since she was talking to them when they were bringing their covers and pillows into the room.
She acted like she wasn’t aware that they were there the entire night.
I received a call when I got out of work from Diana Anderson (DSS) asking me to stay at a hotel.
She wanted to do an intake interview before I could go back into the house.
I located a hotel and rented a room.
After work I drive to Sanford to meet with Diana Anderson.
After the intake she told me that I could go back to the house.
She called Tiffany to ask her if it was ok.
I could hear Tiffany disagreeing with that.
Tiffany said that her parents would pay for the hotel room if I didn’t come home.
I didn’t want to make things worse so I agreed to stay in a hotel again.
Since this was the last night on the Safety Plan I thought that it would give Tiffany time to calm down.
I didn’t see anything good coming from me being at the house with her in that state of mind.
When I got home no one was there.
I called Tiffany’s mother and she didn’t answer.
I then called Tiffany’s step-father.
He answered and I told him my concerns about the children not being there.
We both know that Tiffany has mental issues.
About the time that I hung up, Tiffany called.
She said that she wasn’t coming home.
She was saying that Carter thought that I was going to come into the house and kill everyone.
She then said that she was getting a police escort.
I waited for her to get home with the escort.
She didn’t show for a while so I called dispatch asking if the officer would come by the house.
Officer Brewer called me saying that he was on his way.
He told me that Tiffany was going to a hotel.
Since there was no order of any kind for me not to be there, he said it was ok for me to stay.
I asked if it ok to enter the house and he said that it was fine.
I went inside and Tiffany began to text me.
She said that I wasn’t supposed to be at the house due to the order that I signed at DSS.
I explained that it wasn’t true.
She was getting upset so I just stopped texting her.
They had no record of me, Tiffany or my children.
She said that even if it was approved that I didn’t know where she was anyway.
I had told her during our discussion that this was the case.
I left to go get some breakfast since I wasn’t getting anywhere.
I was driving down the road when I got a text from my boss.
This was by the hotel that we had stayed in when we first came to Sanford.
I thought that I would check to see if my kids were there.
I drove through the parking lot and left.
I immediately received a text from Tiffany asking what I was doing there.
After about 10-15 minutes the lady at the desk received a call.
I could hear Tiff on the other end of the line.
She was telling the lady that I was outside her hotel room.
The lady asked her if she had contacted the police, what kind of car, etc.
About the time that Tiffany got off the phone, Diana was available to see me.
I met with her briefly before going back down to the courthouse.
I told her where I was at and why.
I was sitting outside the courthouse when Tiffany pulled in with the kids.
I saw her walking around the front of the building.
I assumed she didn’t know where the sheriff’s office was located.
I walked around the front but realized that I had my phone in my pocket.
I returned it to my car and then went back around the front.
I entered and talked to the kids a moment before being arrested.
DEC 5th – 13th 20014– I stayed with a friend down in Fayetteville during this time.
He was getting ready to deploy so I couldn’t stay with him that long before he had to leave.
DEC 14th thru the 18th 2014– My mother came in so we stayed at a hotel this week.
Tiffany and mom communicated but mostly she was telling mom that she couldn’t see the kids.
DEC 19th 2014- My mom had been in town all week and hadn't had a chance to see the kids.
She had been talking with Tiff all week trying to figure out when she could come by.
My mother had went to the house on the first night and Tiffany wouldn't let her see them or let her in the house.
By Friday we were ready to leave so we could do Christmas back home in KY.
(Psychologist recommended through work to help me deal with the situation)  Mom decided that she was going to go by the house to see the kids.
She asked me about it and I said that it would be ok since she wasn't restricted by the conditions of my release.
I thought that it would be a good idea to drop off the presents since the kids could have them for Christmas and it would give her more room in her trunk if we stopped to finish up shopping in Nashville.
(We didn't end up going that way home.)
I was at the gas station across from the Tramway shopping center when mom got to our house.
She said they were getting ready to leave.
I thought that I could grab a couple of things if they weren't going to be there.
Mom called me back and said that my ex-wife had come out on the porch.
I said that my ex-wife was there and didn't know how this was going to go.
The dispatcher told me that someone would meet me at Beacon Circle.
Beacon Circle is really close to the house so I drove to the end of Aviation Lane to meet the officer and take advisement from there.
I still had about 40 minutes before my appointment but it was getting close to whether I could grab some stuff before leaving or not.
Next thing I know Tiffany pulls up beside me and starts cussing and yelling at me.
Essentially all hell broke loose.
Our dog comes running up the road, the van door opens and I see my oldest son crying, (I found out later that he had broken his wrist) mom is out of the car beside the van.
Tiff grabs my mom (left bruises on her arms - she is 65) and is yelling along my ex-wife are yelling.
(HWY1)  I get out of the car and tell him that my ex-wife left with my son.
I didn't know what else to say.
I was pretty shaken up about what had just happened and seeing my ex-wife there.
I had no idea why she was there and assumed that she was going to leave with Brendan.
That wouldn't have been good in my opinion.
I did ask my son if he was ok when the van door opened.
Mom asked him if he wanted to come with Nana and he said that it was fine - he would stay.
I left immediately to go back to KY.  We stayed at a hotel somewhere in NC.
No one was allowed to talk to kids – not even their cousins.
I was able to get visitation at this point.
I got to see the kids that night.
My mother was able to go to pick up the kids so they could come see me.
JAN 28th 2015– I found out later that Sara had contacted DSS about her concerns about Tiffany.
She came over that evening to take my statement.
She said that Brendan and Lukas claimed that I had abused them.
I got more information on this later from Sara who had stayed in the house with Tiffany at multiple times over the past few weeks.
FEB 3rd – I went with Sara to DSS today.
She told DSS a bunch of things that happened while she was there that changed her mind about what was going on.
It was hard to listen too.
I got to meet the foster parents.
We were separated, she was on heavy medication for Stage 4 lung cancer, and she was severely mentally ill. She brought up previous accusations about abuse of our children.
The fact that this wasn’t done put my children at risk.
Since we were separated, I was unaware of her state of mind.
I had let her borrow my phone.
It was returned when she passed away.
It was $5,000 out of my pocket and possibly the smoking gun on me being set up.
Her tactic of delay has the intended impact.
Tiffany's Text Messages from Missing Phone (See attachments)
If they had wanted to assess the integrity of Tiffany’s statements, then they could have contacted the children.

The same with the trash from my bathroom that I had bagged to save for the detectives.
The statements about where she ran were disturbing in the fact that they made no sense if she were escaping a dangerous situation.
She took a path that made no sense for someone running for their life and was fearful of everyone there.
She described an event that would be impossible to occur between two people.
If I were to have done this, then I would be a danger to the public, so why would he do that?
He had surgery scheduled for that Friday.
He also said, "Your son didn't do this, I will say a prayer for him and your family."
She stated that both counts were 9-3.
