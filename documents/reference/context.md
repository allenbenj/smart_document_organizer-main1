# Context

## Current Work Focus
- Initial setup of the smart document organizer project
- Creation of the memory bank to document the project's purpose, goals, and architecture
- Analysis of the existing codebase to understand the current state and identify areas for improvement

## Recent Changes
- Created the memory bank directory and core files (brief.md, product.md, context.md, architecture.md, tech.md)
- Initialized the code catalog setup to analyze the project's Python files

## Next Steps
- Complete the code catalog analysis to understand the existing codebase
- Document the system architecture and key technical decisions
- Document the technologies used and development setup
- Update the memory bank with any new information discovered during the analysis
